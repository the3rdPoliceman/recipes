Steak tartare 
Ingredients
400g beef
2 egg yolks
30ml oil
Tbsp Gherkins
Tbsp capers
Tbsp onion
Tbsp brandy
Tbsp ketchup
Tsp chives
Tsp parsley
Â½ Tsp Dijon mustard (maybe a bit less)
Black pepper
Tabasco
Method
Salt beef, and leave in the freezer until it gets a bit stiff but not frozen. Mix oil into egg yolks slowly like making mayo, then add in the rest of the stuff. Wash the salt off the meat, chop it, and add to the other stuff.
Notes
Normally I don't need any extra salt, as the meat soaks up some while in the freezer.
Mustard is a pretty variable, so how much depends on how strong it is.
Not really sure how much pepper i add - a bit more than i would add to most food.
How much tabasco is up to you
