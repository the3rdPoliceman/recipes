# recipe-to-json

A simple project to help enter recipes as easily as possible. This module takes recipes entered in a readable format(see example below) and converts them into JSON, which is later used in conjunction with doT.js to generate HTML pages for each recipe, as part of the build process.

# Usage from gulpfile.js
~~~~
const recipesToJson = require('./recipe-to-json/dist');

function compileMarkdownRecipesToJSON() {
   return src('./RecipeScratchpad/**/*.recipe')
     .pipe(recipesToJson())
     .pipe(dest('./json/Recipes'));
}
