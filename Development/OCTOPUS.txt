SERIOUS EATS

If you want to keep the skin from falling apart, you're better off chilling the octopus after cooking it, which really does make it more resilient.
The starting temperature of the water didn't have any effect
Adding a cork had no effect
tenderizing mith a mallet had no real effect

sous vide at 80C for five hours is a possibility
pressure cooker for around 15 minutes works too
"When searing and grilling, it's a good idea to chill the cooked octopus first, a step that sets the skin and keeps it from sloughing off during the secondary cooking."


SMALL OCTOPUS
Boiled until tender in a lot of water (salted towards the end as it was bland when i tried)
let cool for a couple of hours, as the suggestion was that this would firm it up
then grilled
it was indeed less gelatinous and retained the skin, as proposed. 
Would need to retry this with a larger octopus to see if it works for thats
