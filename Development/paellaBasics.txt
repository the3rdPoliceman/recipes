chicken & rabbit with salt and oil- larger pieces towards the middle. moving them around. until browned
green flat beans
tomatoes, canned, whole
paprika (pimiento dulce)
gorrofon 8 big white beans, chosen for lack of starch released)
snails	
water ( also seemed like he might have sneaked in a bit around the time the garrofon went in, but might have been juices from something)
saffron
boil 20-25 mins
rice. add and make sure it's under the water. don't fuck with it much though
rosemary
cook between simmering and boiling (make 5 pops out loud with your lips in one second to get an idea pop-pop-pop-pop-pop)
towards the end raise the heat to help form socarrat

As you think it's ready (sound is important to determine readiness, probably more than looks), you can dig a spoon down to the bottom of the pan and scratch a little bit in a place or two, to check for the crust (socarrat) on the bottom. Where there's a crust, the spoon won't slide easily across the bottom, but will stick in the crust.

Once it's done, remove the flame, and leave 5-10 minutes to rest

Garlic - if using, add a minute before the tomatoes
Saffron - should be mandatory. Toast in a foil envelope, 10 seconds each side. Add with the stock
