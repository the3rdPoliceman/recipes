PASTEIS DE BELEM

CLUES
=====
Filling is thick when added to case - when the machine pumps it in it sits up like mt fuji

DOUGH
The dough looks buttery on the outside when given to the stretcher/portioner. It is extremely easy to stretch - a piece the size of a large mortadella is stretched into a 4cm sausage in seconds 
Dough is made one day and rests until the next
For dough, maybe sfogliatella gives a clue - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GheM1RLNJ0&t=0s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kdl_56D6yo
This sfogliatella uses butter https://youtu.be/aVRU2Qm1nk0?t=967
Interesting is for sfogliatelle i see 2 using manitoba flour. One guy absolutely insists (although he's ana amateur)
Butter or lard can be used in sfogliatelle - most seem to go for lard, amalfi guy went with butter.

Baking temp - hot. Have heard 350C, and even more

The original shop was a sugar refinery. Maybe suggests syrup, but could be wrong. 
Also, what type of sugar would the refinery have originally produced? That is probably the same as is used.
