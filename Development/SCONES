SCONES

TIPS
-	Do not twist scone cutter ... up and down motion helps scones raise
-	The milk egg wash helps them rise higher because it takes the heat of the oven longer to set them (sceptical)
-	Don't overwork the wet & dry mix
-	If mix is too wet, you'll get biscuits and they won't rise


TIPS FROM HELEN 
-	Moderate protein flour (maybe half/half cake flour normal) 


RECIPE FROM KEVIN (DART TO MOUTH DELI)
1000g self raising

0.5tsp salt
15g baking powder
175g sultanas
375ml milk

Make it to breadcrumbs
Mix in sultanas
Whisk milk, sugar, vanilla and egg together, and add most of it to dry ingredients (leaving some for washing the tops of the scones)
Fold into the dry ingredients with a spatula, until it's almost formed a dough
Tip it out and work it by hand until it's bound together into a non perfect ball
Roll 1 inch thick (maybe 30mm)
Rest some minutes, egg wash the top with the remaining wet mix
bake at 180C for 8.5 minutes. Turn the tray around, and bake another 8.5 minutes

CLOTTED CREAM 
Wikipedia :There are two distinct modern methods for making clotted cream. The "float cream method" includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged.[6] The "scald cream method" is similar but just uses cream. The cream is heated, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged
When authentic clotted cream is not available, there are ways to create a substitute product, such as by mixing mascarpone with whipped cream, a little sugar, and vanilla extract.[36]
Method 1: Boil Cream with a bit of butter until reduced to half
Method 2: Heat oven to 160C, add cream in baking dish and turn off oven. Take it out after 12 hours (roughly i guess). Let it cool for 8 hours, then skim off the clotted cream from the top.
