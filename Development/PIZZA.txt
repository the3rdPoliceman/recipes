DOUGH TECHINQUE
*** Da Michele video shows a lot of detail about making dough by machine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHyfRHIbx_8 
Squeezing balls - https://youtu.be/E4r0tGfTh68?t=251
Tip from Ciro Oliva - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIyInzgDc8I - he adds more or less yeast depending on the temperature - winter more, summer less. Having a controlled temperature would do the same, but if it's not controlled, this might be good
General idea for dough rising measurement - rise a small amount in the same conditions in a narrow vessel (large test tube or mesuring flask) - then it will be easy to see when it doubles

DOUGH KNEADING MACHINES - DOUBLE ARM vs SPIRAL (PIG TAIL) vs ROTATING PINCER
Double arm machines hardly raise dough temperature at all, wheras spiral machines raise it quite significantly. It's better not to raise the temperature, so with a spiral machine you need to keep an eye on it to make sure it's not getting too hot. With the twin arm, you can relax knowing it won't get too warm.
Double arm machines are also supposed to add more air than spiral machines, which may be good or bad, no idea
Da Michele uses a pincer machine - https://youtu.be/EHyfRHIbx_8?t=131
https://www.youtube.com/@renesfoodpassion has comparisons of many machines that are between kitchen aid and professional size
