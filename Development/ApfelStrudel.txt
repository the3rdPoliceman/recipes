Best looking Strudel in Viennas:
Café Landtmann, Universitätsring 4, 1010 Wien
Looks very crispy with well separated layers on top. maybe butter between layers?

Recipe:
Cafe Residenz "Strudel-Show"
	Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHmNZrHcqCE

	Strudel dough: 
		250g flour Type 700 (flour for white bread)
		2g salt
		1 egg
		100g lukewarm water
		20g oil

		Mix all ingredients to a soft dough and knead it until it releases from hands and table. Form it to a ball and let it rest in vegetable oil for 30 minutes. Put the dough on a flourcovered linnen cloth and roll it in a rectangular shape. Drape it over the back of your hands, turning the dough while moving it from arm to the other, until you get a huge wafer thin layer.

	Butter breadcrumbs: 
		100g breadcrumbs (maybe brioche or zopf)
		50g butter

		Melt the butter in a pan, add the breadcrumbs and fry until they turn golden brown.

	Cinnamon sugar: 
		140g sugar
		10g cinnamon

	Filling:
		170g raisins
		a shot of rum
		150g butter breadcrumbs
		150g cinnamon sugar
		10g lemonjuice
		Zest of 1 lemon
		1kg peeled sour apples - cored and sliced
		30g melted butter

		Soak the raisins in the rum to soak it up (probably best overnight).

		Mix all ingredients well.

	Instructions: Heap the filling in a log shape towards one side of the dough and roll it carefully with the cloth. Twist up the excess at the ends to stop the filling coming out as it bakes. Put the Strudel onto a buttered baking tray and bake it in the oven at 190° until it takes on a gold-brown shine. Brush the top with some melted butter

	OPEN QUESTION:
	Original recipe tip said to put butter on the Strudel as soon as you take it out of the oven, but the video said brush butter on top before baking. So now we have 3 options:
		- Butter after baking
		- Butter brushed over the top before baking
		- Butter brushed between each layer before baking


	




Maybe walnuts also good? Toasted and crushed?
