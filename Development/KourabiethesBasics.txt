TIPS
The fluffier the butter mixture, the fluffier the kourabies will become.
Fluffing the butter with the sugar requires a very strong beating. But as soon as the flour is added, be gentle
Kourabies should be baked at low temperatures and not too much so that it does not acquire a rough and hard texture and comes out white.
It is necessary to sweeten when it is cold. Because when it is hot the first layer of sugar creates a thick, soft and stuffed layer that is not pleasant in the mouth.
We must always cover the chocolate cakes well because they absorb moisture very easily and get wet.
They are kept for a long time when they are hermetically sealed.
We can not put almonds and open the dough in a sheet to cut into different shapes e.g. stars, hearts, etc.
