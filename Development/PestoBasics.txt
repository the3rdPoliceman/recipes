RULES
Mortar and pestle  >>>>  Food processor  (italian mortar and pestle with wooden pestle is best, but thai granite good enough). Difference is huge
Untasted pine nuts > toasted. Difference is small, but it's easier not to toast anyway
Cheese - pecorino fiore sardo best, then mix of pecorino roman and parmesan. Difference is ... a bit
Oil - preferably mild
Butter - optional

Everything in pesto is strong, so all ingredients should be the least pungent version of themselves. Young garlic, mild olive oil, Pecorino Sardo cheese instead of Romano, untoasted pine nuts

Washing the leaves before making the pesto helps. The moisture left on the leaves helps them grind down quicker.
