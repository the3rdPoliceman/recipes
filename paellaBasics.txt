chicken & rabbit - larger pieces towards the middle. moving them around. until browned
green flat beans
paprika (pimiento dulce)	
water
gorrofon
snails
saffron
rosemary
rice. add and make sure it's under the water. don't fuck with it much though
get a good boil going, not a simmer
tomatoes were added at some point - i think before the paprika	

As you think it's ready (sound is important to determine readiness, probably more than looks), you can dig a spoon down to the bottom of the pan and scratch a little bit in a place or two, to check for the crust (socarrat) on the bottom. Where there's a crust, the spoon won't slide easily across the bottom, but will stick in the crust.

Once it's done, remove the flame, and leave 5-10 minutes to rest

Garlic - if using, add a minute before the tomatoes
Saffron - should be mandatory. Toast in a foil envelope, 10 seconds each side. Add with the stock
