Spicy Cherry Tomato and Garlic Pasta
Ingredients
Handful Cherry Tomatoes
4 Cloves Garlic left whole
1 Dried Chili left whole
Cream
Basil
Parmesan
Olive Oil
Method
Heat a good layer of Olive Oil in frying pan over medium heat.  
Add the Tomatoes, Garlic and Chili and fry with a lid on the pan, swirling frequently until the Tomatoes start to soften and their skins begin to split.  Remove the Chili, add a splash of Cream and the Basil.  
Mix with the cooked Pasta and serve with Parmesan.
To control spicyness, the Chili can be removed earlier.
