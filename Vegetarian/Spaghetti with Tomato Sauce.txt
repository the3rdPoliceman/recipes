Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce
Ingredients 
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
8 plum tomatoes or 1 tin
Pinch of red chili flakes
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, whole
2 stems of basil, leaves on
Pinch of red chili flakes
8 large leaves of basil
25g butter, unsalted
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano
Method
Skin the tomatoes, separate the flesh, and reserve the seeds.  Heat 2 tablespoons of Oil in a saucepan and add the Tomatoes along with the juice from the Seeds, a good bit of Salt and a pinch of Chilli Flakes.  Mash them a bit, and leave to bubble for 30 minutes or so until they get to a sauce consistency.
Next, make the basil and garlic oil.  Add the Oil, Garlic, Basil, and Chilli Flakes to a pan and heat very slowly until the Garlic is very slightly browned (around 20 minutes).
Strain the Oil and stir into the Tomato Sauce.  Season with Salt.
To Complete
Cook Spaghetti until almost done.  Reserve some of the pasta water and drain.  Add enough Tomato Sauce to a pan, add in the Spaghetti and some of the reserved pasta water.  Cook until the sauce has a good consistency, then add the chopped basil, Parmesan, and Butter.  Mix well and serve.
