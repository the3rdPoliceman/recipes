Smoked Mackerel on Toast
Ingredients
2 Smoked Mackerel Fillets
50-60g Soured Cream
1 Lemon
Bread
Cayenne
Chives 
Method
Make a Pate by blending one of the mackerel fillets with a few teaspoons of lemon juice and enough sour cream to give a nice consistency.  Season, and adjust Lemon Juice to taste.
Slice and toast the bread, then spread a decent amount of Pate each piece.  Flake the other Mackerel Fillet and put some on top.  Dust with cayenne, sprinkle with finely chopped Chives and season with black pepper
