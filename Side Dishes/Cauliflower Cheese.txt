Method
Take Florets off and Boil in salted water with a teaspoon of vinegar for a few minutes.  
Blend the Cauliflower Stalk.  Dice the Shallot and fry in Butter for a couple of minutes, then add the Cauliflower Stalk, Cream, Bay, Thyme.  Simmer for 5 minutes or so, until Cauliflower Stalk is cooked.  Remove the Bay & Thyme, and put everything in a blender, along with a bit less than a quarter of the Cauliflower Florets.  Blend until it’s pureed, and season with Salt, Pepper, Nutmeg, and Curry Powder.
Put the Florets in an ovenproof dish, cover with sauce, grate cheese over, and sprinkle breadcrumbs on top.  Roast until golden, about 15-20 minutes.
