        <div class="guide-section-first">GENERAL TIPS</div>
        <div><strong>Ingredient temperature: </strong>Keeping everything around room temperature before you start seems good</div>
        <div><strong>Nuts: </strong>Taste a few before using them, as sometimes they can be bitter or rancid. Generally nuts taste much better if roasted before baking the cake. Roast at around 175 until starting to color and smelling good</div>
        <div class="guide-section">How to Tell if a Cake is Done</div>
        <div><strong>Sound:</strong> Cakes sizzle and crackle as it’s baking, as the steam is being cooked out. This sound will become softer and slower as the cake gets closer to done and will be just the faintest sound when it’s done</div>
        <div><strong>Edges:</strong> When your cake is done, the edges will pull away from the pan slightly. The edges of the cake are the first part to set and become fully baked, and shrink inward as the cake bakes and the crumb tightens</div>
        <div><strong>Skewer:</strong> A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake, should come out with no streaks of batter. A few small crumbs sticking is fine</div>
        <div><strong>Feel:</strong> I guess this varies a lot by cake type, but start prodding all cakes to get a feel for it</div>
        <div><strong>Temperature:</strong> (Note: Internet info, haven't tested) The internal temperature at which the cake is done varies based on the ingredients, ranging from 93C to 99C. Most classic cakes (butter cakes, pound cakes, chocolate and vanilla cakes, etc.) hover around 98-99C when they're fully baked. Denser cakes like flourless chocolate cake, carrot cake, and red velvet cake may be done at 94-95C</div>

        <div><strong>To increase moistness:</strong> Try a few of the following (those with stars are most recommended) 
            <ul>
                <li>*Add an extra 2-4 tablespoons of sour cream or yogurt to the recipe</li> 
                <li>*Add an extra 2-4 tablespoons of flavorless vegetable oil to the recipe</li>
                <li>*Replace a portion or all of the butter with an equal amount of flavorless vegetable oil</li>
                <li>*Use 1 egg and 2 egg yolks, or 4 egg yolks, in place of 2 eggs</li>
                <li>Substitute light or dark brown sugar for all or a portion of the granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Substitute sour cream or yogurt for 1/2-3/4 of the buttermilk or milk</li>
                <li>Substitute buttermilk for milk</li>
