Soda Bread
Ingredients
180g plain white flour
180g plain wholemeal flour
75g porridge oats
.75 tsp bicarbonate of soda
.75 tsp salt
25g butter, cut in pieces
375ml buttermilk
Method
Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C and dust a baking sheet with flour. 
Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then rub in the butter. Pour in the buttermilk and mix it in quickly with a table knife, then bring the dough together very lightly with your fingertips (handle it very, very gently). Now shape it into a flat, round loaf measuring 20cm/8in in diameter.
Put the loaf on the baking sheet and score a deep cross in the top to let the fairies out( and help the bread to cook through.) Bake for 30-35 minutes until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. If it isnâ€™t ready after this time, turn it upside down on the baking sheet and bake for a few minutes more.
