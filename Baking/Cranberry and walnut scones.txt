Cranberry and walnut scones
Ingredients
260g flour
75g sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
115g butter
250ml whipping cream
75g dried cranberries 
50g chopped walnuts
Method
Heat oven to 230C (non fan). Prepare baking tray with a sheet of wax paper on top.
Mix first four ingredients, then add butter and cut in with a pastry blender or knife. Rub in to finish if it looks not combined.
Add in 220 ml of the cream, and the cranberries and walnuts, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto the wax paper; gently press or pat dough into a 7-inch round (mixture will be crumbly). Cut round into 8 wedges. Slide wedges apart and brush the top with the last of the cream.
Bake until tops are golden brown - check after 13 minutes
