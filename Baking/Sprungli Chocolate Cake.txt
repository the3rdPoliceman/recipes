Ingredients 
(for 25*10 bread pan)
88g egg white (about 4)
100g sugar (1)
140g egg yolk (about 6)
40g sugar (2)

22g cocoa powder

Method
Sponge
Melt the butter in a pan and let it cool.
Wash a bowl and whisk really well, wiping with some vinegar on kitchen paper to remove any possible grease. Whisk the egg white together with sugar (1) to stiff peaks.
Beat sugar (2) and yolk for about 10 minutes.
Mix white flour, cocoa powder, and nuts together.
Sieve the dry ingredients onto the egg yolk mixture and fold in carefully, followed by the egg whites and finally the liquid butter.
Butter the 25*10 bread form, pour in the batter, and bake at 170C for 40 minutes.
Remove from form, cool on a rack. If you want to leave it overnight, cover it with foil, but make sure you let it cool first.
Ganache
Warm the cream until it is boiling. Take the pan off the heat, add in the chopped chocolate and salt, and mix until ganache forms.
Mix with immersion blender to emulsify well.
Place in a shallow bowl, covered with food film, at room temperature. Leave it alone.
Assembling
Trim 1.5mm from each side and end of the cake
Discard the top crust, and split remaining cake into 3 layers
Put ganache into piping bag
Reassemble in the tin it was baked in, first lining it with cling film or acetate so it can be easily removed
Spread a thin layer of ganache on the side/ends and a fairly thin layer on the base
Then take a layer of cake, apply ganache to the edges generously and add to the tin
Repeat until done.
Then spread all remaining ganache on top, level off
Allow to cool and harden, remove from form
Fix any imperfections with some heated knife
Dust the top with cocoa
