INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS RAMEN? 

NOODLES
SOUP
TARE
TOPPINGS
AROMA OIL

Component 1: Noodles are one of the cornerstones of ramen

Component 2: Soup is the other cornerstone of ramen
	CHINTAN: Clear, light, and delicate on the palate. This is the standard broth for most common styles. Similar in impact to a delicate consomme
	PAITAN: Contrary to western-style stock-making, these rapidly boili the contents in the pot which gives a cloudy/creamy consistency.


Component 3: Tare - a potent sauce or paste that seasons (salts) the bowl. Tares often add additional flavour complexity and umami. Three broad categories:
    SHOYU (SOY SAUCE): The original tare. Salt + Umami
    SHIO (SALT): Salt not derived from soy sauce. Usually includes a host of other umami-rich ingredients, like dried seafood or kombu. 
	MISO: Miso is a thicker tare which adds body to the broth. Loaded with umami. 

Component 4: Toppings: Several categories: 
	PROTEINS: The most common variant of this is chashu (a braised pork roast, typically made from belly or shoulder), but chicken or fish products are also typical. Other non-meat-based proteins, such as soft boiled eggs, are also common.
	AROMA BOOSTERS: Alliums, typically scallion, are almost mandatory. Grated ginger or chilies, can also provide complexity and aroma. 
	TEXTURE PROVIDERS: Menma (cured and sweetened bamboo shoots) are crunchy in texture and provide this needed depth. Texture can also be provided in things like bean sprouts, cabbage, corn, wood ear mushrooms, or any other snappy, firm, crunchy things.  

Component 5: Aroma oil: Fat is critical component - it provides mouthfeel, and fat-soluble flavors. Modern ramen shops diligently control the fat content of their final dishes, often adding additional fat that has been cooked with aromatic items like alliums, vegetables, or other aromatic ingredients. Ramen MOSTLY often uses animal fats

CHAPTER 2: SOUP

Can either be made from fresh meat cooked slowly, or dried fish products which cook quickly.

Ramen is generally a meat-based dish, so the focus of this chapter will be primarily on meat-based soups

Soup often seems like a complex process, but the reality is soups are easy. 

The two categories of soups (although it’s more like a continuum than a pure categorization) are:
	Clear soups (CHINTAN)
	Cloudy soups (PAITAN)

The process for meat soups generally goes as follows: 
	1.	Cook animal parts in water to extract flavor and convert collagen to gelatin, which adds thickness and mouthfeel.
	2.	Add aromatics for complexity and to provide water-soluble flavor compounds (this includes dashi elements). 


So, what happens when you make soup?

Collagen Conversion to Gelatin
Why do we want some gelatin? Gelatin is good because it gives soup body.
After heating for a long time, collagen in the meat breaks down into gelatin.

Collagen rich parts include feet, bones, tendons, ligaments, skin. 

Correcting the amount of gelatin: if your soup feels too watery, reduce it or include more bones/connective tissue in subsequent cooks. If it feels too thick, you can add water to it or increase the ratio of water to bones in subsequent cooks.

Myoglobin Denaturation and Scum Formation
Cooked Myoglobin forms scum on stocks, which pretty much everyone skims off.

Fat Rendering 
Rendered fat rises to the top of the soup and stays there until it is skimmed off or emulsified. You can use this fat for making Aroma Oil, or discard. The fat rendered in the soup making process contains all of the fat-soluble flavor compounds extracted, so it has a markedly different flavor than a fat rendered on its own. You  may or may not want this in the final bowl of ramen. 

Aroma and Flavor Extraction
Flavor extraction from meat is directly related to the time and temperature on which it is held. As meat and bones cook, the protein within them denatures, squeezing out water and water-soluble flavor compounds, which then solubilize in the surrounding soup. For many of these compounds, the speed and quantity of this extraction increase with increasing temperature

Other aromatics like vegetables and herbs also follow this rule, but do not take as long to release their flavor into the liquid as meat-based ingredients. Applying heat produces aromatic compounds while the soup cooks, but eventually they run out. A soup with onions cooked for 6 hours will be far less oniony than one cooked for only an hour.
 
Varying armatics cooking times: Shorter cooks for brighter vegetable flavors, longer cooks for more muted flavors. 
1 hour at around 90C is sufficient (chopping or dicing the aromatics smaller reduces this time).

Notes on Garlic: it's a unique ingredient in that, depending on how the clove is prepared, the pungency of the flavor in the final soup changes. Put in whole, the garlic flavor in your soup will be much milder. Crushed with the heel of a knife, some sharpness will remain. If you completely obliterate the garlic into a paste, the flavor will be very sharp and intense. Getting the right amount of garlic punch can be tricky though, as it’s balanced by not only how it’s prepared, but how long it’s cooked.

In ramen it is unusual to brown aromatics and meat when making stocks.

Emulsification
Whats the difference between the cloudy paitan and clear chintan soups? Emulsification(emulsified fat)! Paitans are emulsions, and chintans are not. When you want to make an emulsion, in addition to an emulsifier you need shearing i.e. combining into a smooth emulsion (like a salad dressing), normally by physical agitation. Ramen cooks use many tools to emulsify fat into soup. 

Gelatin As An Emulsifier 
Gelatin is an emulsifier, as it is attracted to fat and water. Gelatin, with enough shearing and fat, emulsifies very quickly (in as little as 30 seconds in a blender). And because gelatin is a strong emulsifier, it stays that way once it’s done. 

How to emulsify?
Rapid boiling
Using a blending device

Other Emulsifiers: Starch and Protein Blending
Perhaps the most readily available for most home cooks is white rice. Rice is great because it’s effective and doesn’t add flavor to the final dish. The method itself is simple: add a few tablespoons of rice to your soup an hour before blending. As the rice cooks, it releases starch, which traps residual fat globules and helps suspend them in the water-based soup. 

Protein slurries, such as blended meat scraps, can also provide similar emulsification. Tenkaippin, a Japanese ramen shop chain, uses a technique where they take cooked, shredded, chicken thigh meat, and blend it into the soup until it’s viscous and emulsified. The tsukemen recipe listed here uses this technique.

How to Measure Gelatin and Emulsion Quality
The empirical test: Taste the soup. Does it feel full-bodied? Do you like the texture of it on your tongue? That’s the gelatin and fat increasing the viscosity.

The chill test: After cooking, let a sample of your final soup chill completely in the fridge. How firmly does the gel hold? A firmer gel is the result of more gelatin in solution. 

A refractometer: Large ramen chains and meticulous chefs use this method to maintain consistency of the final soup. This is the most accurate approach, but it requires special equipment. 

COOKING SOUP: MANY APPROACHES
For soups, cooks most often use a large stockpot to hold the contents, completely cover them with water, and cook everything over a burner at the desired temperature until the soup is complete. Traditionally, chintan soups are delicately simmered, while paitans are rapidly boiled (at some point or for the entire cooking process), both for long periods of time. 

Using the knowledge mentioned earlier and this little bit of information, you can start making soup. However, you can use some alternative approaches to make either chintans or paitans, especially if you’re a home cook. 

Pressure cookers have become popular recently, and I use a pressure cooker in almost all of my soup making. The only thing to be aware of is that pressure cooking can lead to emulsification, and maybe you don't want that. So you want to release the pressure slowly (David - I guess with water and cooling the pot but not sure)

Once the soup is complete, you need to hold it hot or chill it thoroughly and quickly. 

In general, bird bones are more porous than those of other land animals, and thus they require less cooking. Below is a generalized time table for making soups.  

Ingredient
Stovetop (At 88 °C/190 °F or higher)
Pressure Cooker (at full pressure, 15 psi, assuming 10 quarts max capacity) 
Chicken (whole, backs, feet, all chicken) 
6 hours
45 minutes (or 30 minutes with 30-minute natural release) 
Pork neck bones
8 hours
1 hour (or 45 minutes with 30-minute natural release) 
Pork femur bones
18 hours
Up to 2 hours 
Fish
1 hour
10 minutes



Dashi 

Before we dive into styles of soup, there’s a critical soup component that needs a little more detail and needs to be made ahead of time. Ramen chefs often add liberal quantities of this ingredient to their soups, and that is also true for the recipes in this book. I’m talking about that subtle but umami amplifying stock, used in all sorts of other Japanese soups, dashi.

Dashi is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking and it would be a disservice to not mention it in some capacity in this book. The term “dashi” is often used as a catchall term in modern Japanese for soup, but most typically refers to a soup made from kombu and dried fish products. An entire book could be written on dashi. In fact, Heston Blumenthal already wrote one20. Dashi has been the subject of intense discussion, debate, and research, due to its importance to the Japanese culinary arts, and it’s remarkable ability to add a meaty flavor to food. 

In general, I don’t fuss about the specifics. Tap water is fine. However, excessive heat impacts the final result considerably, so avoid boiling.  

Dashi can be added to soup, but I find that it’s easier to add the ingredients used in dashi to soup directly. 

The ingredients used in dashi add fantastic complexity to ramen. Katsuobushi is smoky, niboshi is fishy and pungent, clams are briny and sweet, and kombu is oceanic. For simplicity, I often just add these ingredients at the end of the cook, much like with other aromatics. By the time these ingredients are added, the soup is no longer boiling and it’s at an appropriate temperature for most extractions. Still, you’ll have to play around with what works for you. 


=============================================================================
=============================================================================
=============================================================================
DASHI RECIPES
Alternatively, if you’d like to add dashi to soup, rather than adding just the ingredients, below are a few dashi recipes. They are by no means exhaustive (again, dashi is inherently complex stuff with many variations). Dashi can also be used to thin out thick soups in a pinch or will be used as part of the soup technique known as “double soup” (more on this one later).

Basic Dashi

This is an all-purpose dashi. If you’re not sure where to start, this is a safe bet. It’s simple but versatile.

Some variants of dashi also suggest an overnight soak before cooking can increase the amount of flavor extracted. To do this, simply combine the kombu (and niboshi or shiitake, if using) and water, and place in the fridge for 12-24 hours before cooking. Then proceed with step 2. 

Ingredients: 
1 L cold water
10 g kombu
25 g katsuobushi (or replace with niboshi, or shiitake, as desired) 

Steps: 
Add the cold water and kombu to a pot (if using niboshi or shiitake, add with the kombu). 
Heat over medium-low heat until just below simmer, around 80 °C.
Turn off the heat and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.
Remove the kombu, add the katsuobushi (if using). 
Bring up to a simmer, then turn off the heat again, cover, and allow to steep until flavored to your liking, anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.
Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed.

Dashi degrades quickly in flavor, so it only keeps for a few days in the fridge if you decide to make it in advance. Luckily, it’s relatively simple to put together. 

Clam Dashi 

Clam in ramen is becoming more popular and this is a simple soup that can be combined with others to create complexity. This dashi is clam forward, containing only 3 ingredients, but some additional steps are needed to treat the clams appropriately. This dashi can also have dashi elements like katsuobushi or niboshi steeped in it after it is complete, should you choose to do so. If you’d like to use the clams for eating after, you’ll need to remove the grit from them first (see the first steps of this recipe).

Ingredients: 
1 L cold water
20 g sake
500 g clams (manila or cherrystone) 

Steps: 
To remove the grit from the clams, place them in cold water and allow them to sit undisturbed for one hour.
Wash the clams and scrub their exteriors to remove any residual dirt on the outside.
Combine 1 L cold water, sake, and cleaned clams in a pot. 
Heat over high heat until reaching a simmer.
Cook the clams at a simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the shells have opened and the clams are completely cooked.  
Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed. You can then harvest the meat for alternative purposes. 

Much like the previous dashi, this only keeps for a few days in the fridge should you choose to make it in advance. 


Bacon Dashi

This idea is blatantly ripped off from David Chang and Peter Meehan’s cookbook, “Momofuku: a Cookbook25.” I won’t even pretend to have come up with the idea. It’s excellent for those who struggle to find Japanese ingredients, the bacon providing smoke and umami in place of katsuobushi. 

Ingredients:
1 L cold water
10 g kombu
100 g bacon (raw, preferably thick cut or end pieces from a whole slab) 

Steps: 
Add all ingredients to a pot. 
Heat over medium-low heat until just below a simmer, around 80 °C/176 °F.
Turn off the heat and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.
Remove the kombu.
Bring up to a simmer, then turn off the heat again, cover, and allow to steep until flavored to your liking, around 30 minutes.
Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed.


These dashi recipes will pop up on occasion in the next soups. But onto the main methods for Chintan and Paitan. 
Basic Chintan Method

Ingredients: 
Animal parts (such as chicken backs, pork neck bones, femurs, or other bones of your liking)
Some amount of water (starting at equal parts, and going up to two parts, by weight, depending on the result and amount of connective-tissue laden ingredients). 
Aromatic vegetables and ingredients for complexity

Steps: 
Submerge the animal parts with water.
Heat over high heat until the pot begins to boil.
Skim the scum that rises to the top.
Reduce the heat to below sub-simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F) to preserve clarity.
Cook for the recommended time based on ingredients.
In the last hour, add the aromatics.
Strain the soup.

From this framework, you can make a host of different soups. Want a beef soup with caramelized onions? Cook the beef bones for 8 hours, then toss in those onions at the last hour. Want a super fishy, really rich, but clear chicken soup? Cook the chicken parts, being sure to include some feet, for 6 hours, adding in dashi elements like bushi products or niboshi, at the last hour. 

Below are some common recipes I use for chintan, depending on need. 

=============================================================================
=============================================================================
=============================================================================
CHINTAN RECIPES

Tokyo Style Chintan
This recipe is a combination of chicken and dashi elements. It’s simple and effective with many different ramen tares.

Ingredients:  
one stewing hen (approximately 3 kg/6.6 lb), broken down into primal sections (legs, wings, breasts, frame)  
1 kg/2.2 lb chicken feet 
6 L water
1 onion 
10 cloves garlic
1 5-cm/2-in piece of ginger
20 g kombu
20 g niboshi
20 g katsuobushi

Steps: 
Add the chicken to a stockpot, cover with water.
Bring the soup up to a boil briefly, skim any scum. Hold here for 5-10 minutes, or until scum subsides.
Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around  88 °C/190 °F), hold for 5 hours.
Add your onion, garlic, ginger, niboshi, and kombu. Cook for an additional 45 minutes. 
In the last 10 minutes, add the bonito flake and steep. 
Strain the soup and hold it until needed.

“Doubutsu Kei” Style Chintan
This recipe combines chicken and pork products to produce a more round amino acid profile. Lighter in body, this soup is excellent in Miso, it’s also good with shoyu applications. I like to blanch the pork neck bones to remove some of the myoglobin and preserve clarity, but this is optional. 

Should you desire, you can also use all chicken backs, or all pork bones, for this recipe. 

Ingredients:  
2 kg/4.4 lb pork neck bones
2 kg/4.4 lb chicken backs
6 L water
1 onion, peeled and halved 
10 cloves garlic, peeled.
1 2-inch piece of ginger

Steps: 
Blanch the pork neck bones briefly by covering them with cold water in a pot, bringing them to a boil, and cooking for 15-20 minutes, or until the scum subsides. Strain the bones and reserve. 
Add neck bones and chicken backs to new water in a stockpot, bring to a simmer, and skim any scum that rises, for around 5-10 minutes. 
Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around  88 °C/190 °F), hold for 7 hours (additional time to account for the pork bones). 
Add your onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook for an additional hour. 
Strain the soup and hold until needed.

All-Purpose Chintan
This recipe is very similar to the doubutsu kei soup mentioned before, but excludes the ginger and pork, making this an overarchingly all-purpose soup, even in non-ramen applications. 

Ingredients:  
4 kg/8.8 lb chicken backs
6 L water
1 onion, peeled and halved
10 cloves garlic, peeled.

Steps: 
Add chicken backs to fresh water in a stockpot, bring to a simmer, and skim any scum that rises, for around 5-10 minutes. 
Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around  88 °C/190 °F), hold for 5 hours
Add your onion and garlic. Cook for an additional hour. 
Strain the soup and hold it until needed.
New Wave Chicken Chintan
The new wave of shoyu ramen emerging in Tokyo is based on a very specific trend of using only chicken, and nothing else. The method is effectively the same as other chintan applications. 

Ingredients:  
4 kg/8.8 lb chicken backs (or two small chickens, broken down, breasts removed) 
4 L water

Steps: 
Add the chicken to a stockpot, cover with water.
Bring the soup up to a boil briefly, skim any scum. Hold here for 5-10 minutes, or until scum subsides.
Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F), hold for 6 hours.
Strain the soup and hold it until needed. 
Eifukucho Taishoken style Chintan
This recipe is derived from a video I found some time ago showing some of the ratios used at Eifukucho Taishoken, a legendary ramen shop in Tokyo, one of the oldest continually operating shops in Japan, and is in general indicative of old-school ramen from Tokyo, heavy with pork and fish products. They focus on a fish-forward soup, with lots of vegetables, and a relatively low quantity of pork. The soup is simple to produce but maddeningly complex. Of note, the final soup is noticeably murky, but this isn’t a bug, it’s a feature. Old school soups are not as clear as modern interpretations. 

Ingredients:  
4 L water
1 kg pork bones
375 g niboshi
60 g katsuobushi
60 g Sababushi
37 g Kombu
140 g onion (1/2 onion)
4 scallions
8 garlic cloves
160 g potato (about half a potato) 
10 g ginger (1-2 inch piece)

Steps: 
Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.
Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20 minutes.
Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F), 7 hours.
In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at below simmer.
Strain the soup and reserve until needed. 

Note: This soup is unique in that, due to the extremely high quantity of fish, a lower salinity tare, or less tare overall, is preferable. As an example, for 350 ml soup, I would use only 22 ml of the new wave tare. 
Yamagata Style “Akayu’ Chintan
This recipe is in fact similar to the Eifukucho Taishoken recipe, in that the shop comes from the early 60s. You’ll notice similarities in method across older shops, that they use a higher ratio of water to bones, and heavily dump in fish products to provide umami. This soup is specifically meant to be paired with other Akayu recipes (please see the appendix for details), the aromatics pair nicely with a miso tare. 

Ingredients:  
1.5 kg/3.4 lbs femur bones
3 L water
Half a carrot
One inch slice of a cabbage head
8 cloves Garlic
One bunch of green onions
30 grams Niboshi
15 g Kombu
15 g Katsuobushi

Steps: 
Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.
Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20 minutes.
Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F), 7 hours.
In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at below simmer.
Strain the soup and reserve until needed. 

Vegetable Chintan
I have been asked on some occasions to develop vegan and vegetarian options for ramen. Understandable of course, as these are reasonable dietary restrictions. However, vegetarian soups run into a few challenges, notably, they lack viscosity and umami. We can control for umami by including Kombu and Shiitake, which gives glutamic acid guanylic acid, but viscosity is difficult. This soup has a wonderful perfume, but is distinctly light in texture, so it pairs best with a tare that amplifies viscosity, like a Miso tare, or a Tantanmen tare. 

Ingredients:  
3 L water
One onion, split and peeled
One carrot, peeled, cut into large chunks
10 cloves Garlic
1 2-inch piece of ginger
10 g dried shiitake
One bunch of green onions
20 g Kombu

Steps: 
Add the water, onion, carrot, garlic, ginger, and shiitake to a pot
Bring up to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. 
Cook at a simmer (around 95 °C/203 °F) for one hour
Add the green onion and kombu, turn off the heat, and let steep for 15 minutes.
Strain the soup and reserve until needed

=============================================================================
PAITAN RECIPES
Basic Paitan Method

The only major difference between the paitan and the chintan method is the rate of boil needed to emulsify the fat. And even this isn’t necessary if you’d like to use a blender, the churning action of the rapid boil isn’t required. 

Ingredients: 
Animal parts (such as chicken backs, pork neck bones, femurs, or other bones of your liking)
An equal part by weight of water. (Add more water for thinner result) 
Aromatic vegetables and ingredients for complexity

Steps: 
Submerge the animal parts with water. If using pork bones, you may wish to soak the bones overnight to remove some of the myoglobin. 
Heat over high heat until the pot begins to boil.
Skim the scum that rises to the top. If using pork bones, you may opt to discard the water and start again with fresh water, bringing up to a boil.
Continue to boil over medium/medium-high heat for the recommended time based on ingredients. Add water to maintain sufficient coverage of the bones (as evaporation occurs as the bones cook). 
In the last hour, add aromatics, and continue to boil.
You may optionally mash the contents of the pot to promote emulsification and full extraction.
Strain the soup and reserve or chill thoroughly. If not fully emulsified, blend the desired amount of fat into soup until the emulsion level desired is achieved. 

Virtually all paitans in this book will follow this approach. The last step, in particular, is noteworthy because it is unorthodox, and typically only conducted in a home setting. You could theoretically emulsify all of the soup with all the fat, resulting in something not unlike milk or cream. You may not want this level of emulsification. Ultimately you as the cook decide how far you’d like the emulsion to go. 

Below are some specific recipes I use regularly. 

Tonkotsu Soup
Tonkotsu is a paitan of pork bones. This is the basic tonkotsu approach that most restaurants essentially use. You may find in your research that some restaurants add in new bones midway through cooking, or use different bones like heads or ribs, but overall, the method is effectively the same: cook bones to death, and emulsify everything. 

Ingredients
2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
6 L water
optional (to add additional fat): 0.5 kg/1.1 lb fatback
optional aromatics: 1 onion, halved, and 10 peeled garlic cloves
 
Steps:
The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting tonkotsu is whiter in appearance).
When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you’ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white tonkotsu, don’t skip it, and don’t end it prematurely.
Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.
Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices. 
Add your now clean bones to a pot.
Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.
If using, add aromatics to the broth in the last hour.
Strain the soup.
To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won’t be as strong. 
Reserve the soup as needed. 

Roasted Bone Tonkotsu Soup
In my desire to stop having to skim and manage scum and funk in tonkotsu, I opted to try roasting all of the bones in the ingredient bill. The resulting broth is slightly darker, but with a blend, it turns quite creamy regardless. 

Ingredients
2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
6 L water
optional aromatics: 1 onion, halved, 10 peeled garlic cloves, 1 2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced
 
Steps:
Preheat the oven to 230 °C/450 °F
When heated, place the bones on a sheet tray, and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, turning the bones halfway, until they look brown and caramelized. 
Add the bones to a pot with water to cover. You may opt to also deglaze the roasting tray with more water, and add this water to the pot. 
Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.
If using, add aromatics to the broth in the last hour.
Strain the soup.
To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won’t be as strong. 
Reserve the soup as needed. 

Jiro Style Tonkotsu Soup

The soup that I enjoy In Jiro is a mix between a paitan and a chintan, but feel free to make it really clear, or really emulsified, the process is the same both ways, you'll just finish it differently. Critical to the success of this dish is the method of cooking the chashu and fat in the soup directly, an old school technique that provides additional flavor to the final soup. 

Ingredients: 
2 kg/4.4 lb femur bones
4 L water
1.5 kg/3.3 lbs pork shoulder, boneless, cut into 2-3 inch wide strips. You can also use belly, the method is identical
.5 kg/1.1 lb backfat

Steps:

Optional, to remove funk, blanch the bones by adding them to cold water, and bringing to a boil. Most jiro shops avoid this and just skim during phase 2. 
Add bones to 4 L water, cook 5 hours at a simmer
Add pork shoulder and back fat to the pot, cook an additional 2 hours
Remove now cooked chashu and backfat, checking for doneness. The pork should be tender enough that a chopstick enters easily. When cooked to your textural liking, reserve until needed (for chashu, add to tare, for back fat, chop into pieces and place in a container until needed). Boil the soup for another 30 minutes. 
Poke femurs interiors with a chopstick or small knife to help release marrow (and allow it to fall back into the pot)
Strain. Should yield around 3 quarts, add water to get to this. Chill soup thoroughly.
For a clearer soup, skim and discard fat that has solidified on top of the soup after chilling. For a cloudier soup, keep all fat, and use an immersion blender or jar blender to combine. For in-between, remove some fat. You get the idea.

Tonkotsu Gyokai Soup
This is a riff on tonkotsu that incorporates fish elements. Packed with umami, it’s also decadently rich. 

Ingredients:
2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
6 L water
Half of a pig trotter
1 onion 
10 garlic cloves
1 2-inch piece of ginger
20 g kombu
30 g niboshi
30 g katsuobushi
30-50 g gyofun (fish powder) 

Steps:
The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting tonkotsu is whiter in appearance).
When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you’ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white tonkotsu, don’t skip it, and don’t end it prematurely.
Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.
Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices. 
Add your now clean bones to a pot.
Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently and adding water to ensure bones are covered. 
Add the onion, garlic, ginger, kombu, niboshi, and katsuobushi to the soup, turning off the heat, letting it steep for one hour. 
Strain the soup.
Add one-quarter of the soup to a blender with the gyofun and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. 
Combine with the remaining soup, and reserve the soup as needed. 


Chicken Paitan
A simpler approach for making a creamy soup at home, chicken paitan is full-bodied and rich in chicken flavor.  

Ingredients:
3 kg/6.6 lb chicken backs
1 kg/2.2 lb chicken feet
6 L water
1 onion, split in half
10 garlic cloves
1 2-in piece of ginger
Optional: green onions, carrot, etc

 Steps:

Add the chicken parts and water to a pot. 
Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising.
Cook at a medium boil for 6 hours, stirring frequently, and adding water to ensure bones are covered. 
Add aromatics, boil thoroughly for one hour. 
Strain the soup.
To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won’t be as strong. 
Reserve the soup as needed. 

“Cement” Ramen 
Despite the name, this style specifically refers to the color of the soup, which is a greyish/greenish hue. The color comes from blending in whole niboshi and niboshi powder before straining, a slightly unorthodox but effective technique for adding additional flavors. This is a popular but admittedly polarizing style, heavy on fish notes, and can be daunting. But the soup is a fish lover’s delight. The blended fish helps to stabilize the emulsion. 

Ingredients:
2 kg / 4.4 lb pork femurs, split to expose their marrow
4 L water
1 onion, halved
1 2-in piece of ginger, peeled and sliced into thin coins
8 cloves of garlic
300 g niboshi, medium-sized
20 g kombu
35 g niboshi, small sized

 
Steps:
Combine medium-sized niboshi and kombu, cover with 2 L water, place in the fridge to soak overnight (This overnight soak is to help save time, over traditional dashi. You can also follow the dashi method shown here). 
Soak pork bones in water overnight.
Take soaked pork bones, discard soaking water, and add to new water in a pot. Bring to high heat and blanch to remove scum, around 5-10 minutes at a rolling boil.
Strain, discard blanching liquid. Cover with 4 L of new water. Boil for 18 hours. 
After 18 hours, add aromatics and boil for 1 hour.
Strain. You should have around 2-3 L.
Add steeped niboshi and kombu mix to strained soup. Bring to a boil. At 80 °C/176 °F, discard kombu.
Reduce heat to lowest on the stove, simmer the niboshi for 1 hour.
Strain soup, reserving niboshi.
In a blender, blend the small niboshi to form a powder. 
Add reserved niboshi from step 9 to the powder-filled blender jar, and enough soup to cover (including as much un-emulsified fat as possible). Blend on high until grey/green slurry is formed. The niboshi should be quite soft at this stage.
Add slurry back to the soup, mix to incorporate.
Strain one more time to remove the residual pulp, pressing on pulp to achieve full extraction.
Reserve soup until needed. 

Tsukemen “Thick” Soup 
Unlike previously mentioned paitan soups, this soup blends essentially all ingredients together to create an extremely thick and rich soup, similar to a gravy. 

This soup is extremely difficult to make, so I’ve included a recipe specifically for a pressure cooker. Like all soups, you can choose to make it via the stovetop, but you’ll need to multiply the cook times in steps 3 and 7 by 8.  

Ingredients:
4 L water
1.5 kg/3 lb pork bones, a mix of femurs and necks
1.5 kg/3 lb chicken backs
0.5 kg/1 lb chicken feet
1 kg/2.5 lb belly and skin and ribs, or 0.5 kg/1 lb ribs, and a 1 kg/2 lb pork belly roast, with skin included
1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
1 5-cm/2-in piece of ginger, peeled and sliced into 0.5 cm/0.25 in coins
10 garlic cloves
20 g kombu
80 g niboshi
50 g thick-cut katsuobushi
50 g thick-cut sababushi
30 g gyofun (fish powder)

Steps:
Add your water and pork bones to a pressure cooker, at least an 8-quart size cooker, but preferably 10-quart.
Bring to a boil, and skim the scum, until little to none rises, around 20 minutes.
Cover, bring to high pressure, cook for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, deskin the pork belly, roll into a cylinder. If attached to the ribs, cut along the ribs to remove the belly first.
While cooking, remove the toenails of the chicken feet.
Open the pressure cooker using the fast release setting, add the chicken backs, chicken feet, tied pork belly, ribs, and pork belly skin.
Close the pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, cook for 1 hour.
Fast release again, open the pressure cooker, remove the pork belly roll, and reserve for chashu.
Add the onion, ginger, and garlic. Boil for 1 hour uncovered. Add water as needed to keep things submerged, but some evaporation is expected.
Strain the soup, reserving the pulp of bones and meat and vegetables. Do not discard pulp.
Dig through the pulp to remove large bones, like femurs, or extra chunky neck bones. You’ll notice at this stage that the bones are quite brittle and can break under pressure. Any bones you can crumble in your fingers are good to keep.
Blend 2/3rds the bones, meat, vegetables, in a blender, with enough soup to make a slurry.
Add the slurry back to the strained soup. Mix to combine. Yields 3.5 L, add or boil water to get to this level.
Add the slurry to a large pot, and add kombu and niboshi. Heat to below simmer (around 80-90 °C/176-194 °F), and allow it to steep for 20 minutes.
Discard kombu, bring the soup to a simmer, and add remaining ingredients (katsuobushi, sababushi, and gyofun).
Remove from heat, steep 15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent burning on the bottom of the pot, as the sludge can settle and scorch.
Strain soup through a porous strainer to remove fish, pressing on pulp to ensure full extraction.
The final yield is around 2.5 L, which is around 10 generous servings.


Additional Techniques for Soup
Most of the recipes shown were done in one pot, or don’t remove any impurities beyond skimming and straining. Sometimes you may want to combine flavors from two differently cooked products, or you may want to further clarify the soup. I’ll discuss techniques for both interests next. 


Double Soup 
Around the turn of the 2000s, a relatively new method of combining separate soups just before serving emerged, called the “double soup” method. This approach is unique in that it takes essentially two soups that have been cooked separately, and combines them. 

The theory behind this technique is that by cooking different ingredients separately, and then combining, you have more control over the specific outcomes of each part. A vegetable soup can be cooked at a specific temperature and time, a meat soup at different conditions, a dashi at different conditions, etc. Then they’re chilled and combined once reheated. The main consideration for any cook with this approach is just dilution. When combining dashi with meat soup, as an example, the amount of water dramatically increases, reducing final gelatin content. This also grants a cook a lot of control if they’ve prepared a lot of parts to work with.

Consider the following example:



The above soup declines in Brix due to the dilution from the dashi. This can be compensated for by increasing the relative gelatin content of the Chicken Soup, either by reducing the amount of water used or increasing the amount of chicken. But this may not be possible if the water doesn’t cover the bones. At home, this is mitigated easily by just combining all ingredients in one pot. So this tends to be my approach: 



In my opinion, the double soup method is better suited for restaurants than home cooks, primarily because it allows for separation of complex tasks in a busy kitchen, and to help scale down the volume of soup made. Rather than making a 40-quart singular pot, a restaurant can make multiple smaller batches of concentrated soup, which are then easier to strain, and can be held cold, combined when needed. The soup is then diluted accordingly. A home cook may not have this problem (unless they’re eating a lot of ramen of course!).
Soup Clarification

In some instances, you may accidentally over boil the soup and create some emulsification you didn't originally anticipate or desire, or you may wish for your soup to be even clearer than what you’ve wound up with. Clarification is the process of removing those emulsified components and in turn, making the soup clear again. 

Clarification as a technique in ramen is rare, most likely due to the amount of effort required at the volume most shops need and the relatively low payoff for doing so. The level of clarity achieved through clarifying is extremely high, almost to the point of the soup being alarmingly crystal clear. However, the process can also remove some flavor compounds, and most guests will still respect a “very” clear soup vs one that is completely clear. Visually though, completely clear soup is definitely appealing.
  
The easiest method is the “raft” method, which uses a combination of egg whites and ground meat to create a floating raft on the surface of the liquid. As the soup boils, it rises and falls through the raft, and the network of coagulated proteins traps globules of fat and debris, clarifying the stock. The negative of this approach, as mentioned earlier, is that it can flavor the soup. Some methods use acidifying agents to improve the clarification, but again, this will add further flavor to the soup.

Ingredients:
5 egg whites, and their shells, crushed, lightly whipped together
0.5 kg/1.1 lb of ground chicken (or ground pork if you’d like) 
Soup for clarifying (quantity should be at least 4 L), all fat removed

Steps: 
Combine the egg whites and ground chicken, set aside
Bring the soup to a simmer
Add the egg white and ground chicken mixture to the soup, whisking thoroughly to allow the mixture to disperse. 
Once dispersed, stop whisking and bring the soup back to a simmer. Allow a raft of coagulated meat and egg to form. 
Allow the soup to cook for 15-30 minutes at a simmer, or until desired clarity is reached
Carefully strain the soup, ideally without disturbing the raft. Some opt to line a strainer with cheesecloth to discard the raft first, others use a ladle to scoop the soup from the top of the raft bit by bit. 

Ultimately, while this approach results in a great, clear soup, it falls into the role of diminishing returns in my opinion. Most ramen soups are not this clear. Don’t sweat it.

CHAPTER 3: TARE

Tare is the secret sauce of ramen, and I’d argue it’s more important than soup. Most chefs hide their ramen making secrets in their tare.

Tare provides three things: 
	Salinity
	Flavor 
	Umami 

Almost all chefs keep tares and soups separate until serving because it increases flexibility, and leaves it easier to correct salinity

SALT:
The primary function of tare is to season the soup. Before the addition of tare, a ramen broth has no salt. Often the broth will taste boring or bland or bad but THE SOUP NEEDS SALT. Which is what tare is for. 

FLAVOR:
Tare provides flavor, no question. Tares are chock full of intensely flavored ingredients. Kombu, shiitake, soy sauce, miso, these are not subtle ingredients. So tares are flavor bombs. 

Like other aromatics used in soup, many of the foundational tare ingredients contain flavor compounds that also volatilize when exposed to heat over prolonged periods. By separating the tare from the soup, you can  control the degree of intensity of your seasoning ingredients. 

UMAMI:
In the introduction, I suggested that you could also add umami to ramen by adding tare. While the meat-based soups described in this book provide some umami, tare increases the umami way more than anything else in ramen. There are two ways that ingredients can provide umami: through the addition of glutamic acid directly or the addition of ingredients with “synergistic nucleotides” that improve the sensation of glutamic acid on the palate. We’ll cover each. 

Umami From Glutamic Acid 
In ramen, glutamic acid commonly comes from soy sauce, kombu, and miso. There are other ingredients that include glutamic acid, and much of the modern ramen making thought involves pushing the content of glutamic acid forward. 

MSG: But we can cheat a little - MSG and ramen go hand in hand. Often shops brag about not using it, because of how rare a lack of MSG actually is.

A Personal Note on MSG 
I love MSG. In small amounts, it greatly increases the savory characteristics of dishes, amplifies flavors, and makes ramen taste more cohesive. It also can help balance off-flavors, which is why most Tonkotsu shops in Kyushu rely heavily on MSG in their ramen.


Umami From Synergistic Nucleotides

All sorts of foods have them. 
	IMP is found in seafood (particularly niboshi and katsuobushi), chicken, and pork. 
	Guanosine monophosphate (GMP) is commonly found in tomatoes and mushrooms. Older ramen cooks were using these compounds to their benefit, they just didn’t know it.

Tares are categorized, but many shops will blend different types, so again it is a continuum

=============================================================================
SHOYU TARE RECIPES

Shoyu, or soy sauce, is the oldest style of tare. Ramen doesn’t exist without this one, because the origins of ramen lie in Japanese cooks re-imagining Chinese soups with local tastes in mind. It was the late 19th century in Japan, and meat was rarely consumed by locals. You have an influx of immigrants, many Chinese, who cooked meat-based dishes. According to Slurp! A Social and Culinary History of Ramen, the story goes that Japanese cooks, put off by the smell of meat and garlic found in these foreign soups, wanted to adopt these Chinese noodle soups for a more local audience1. To temper those unfamiliar and unsavory meat scents, they used soy sauce—and thus the first iteration of ramen was born.

There are many variants of shoyu tare because often it is the most multi-purpose seasoning. Typically I follow a baseline ratio of:

450 g soy sauce
50 g mirin (for sweetness) 
30-45 g umami building ingredients (kombu, fish, etc) 

I enjoy doing a cold soak with the umami ingredients to extract as much flavor as possible from them. The tare needs punch, so a prolonged steep is helpful in my experience. 

If you’d like something less soy-forward, simply swap the soy sauce with some amount of water, and add salt. For every 20 g of soy sauce you remove, add 1-2 g salt (depending on preferences). This assumes Soy sauce is around 14% salt by weight. 

Sake and sugar can be added to further provide complexity and sweetness, but the idea, in my opinion, is to find a template you enjoy for your tare, and stick with it when designing new recipes. Adjusting too many variables can result in difficulty in understanding what works and what does not. 

Standard Shoyu Tare

This is an all-purpose shoyu tare. Great for light chicken broths, it also works well to make shoyu tonkotsu or other shoyu-forward recipes. Make it, keep it in the fridge for months, and use it when you feel like having a clean bowl. 

Ingredients:
450 g soy sauce
15 g kombu
50 g mirin
40 g sake
15 g niboshi
15 g katsuobushi
30 g brown sugar

Steps: 
Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, niboshi, and sake in a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F and hold for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Bring to 82 °C/180 °F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 
Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 °C/180 °F for 5 more minutes. 
Add the sugar, whisking to dissolve.
Strain the tare, and reserve the tare as needed and keep refrigerated. This stores in the fridge for up to 6 months. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup. 

Toasted Shoyu Tare

This is a variant on the Standard Shoyu Tare. For those who like those caramelized, fish forward flavors, this is a good option, as the rapid heating of the niboshi here amplifies their flavor in the final tare. 

Ingredients:
450 g soy sauce
15 g kombu
Vegetable oil (15 mL or so) 
20 g niboshi
15 g katsuobushi
50 g mirin
40 g sake

Steps: 
Combine the soy sauce and kombu into a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
When ready, heat a saucepan over medium heat. 
Add your niboshi and vegetable oil, toast for 30-45 seconds, or until fragrant and starting to brown.
Add your soy sauce and kombu to the pot with the niboshi.
Heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Bring 82 °C/180 °F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 
Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 °C/180 °F for 5 more minutes. 
Strain and reserve liquid on the side.
In a new clean pot, add your mirin and sake. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Add this mixture to your mixture from step 9. You can store this in the fridge for up to 6 months. 

Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup. 


New Wave Shoyu Tare 

New wave shoyu tare style primarily focuses on soy sauce as the flavoring of the dish, and should therefore include exceptionally high-quality soy sauce. Look for soy sauces that are traditionally made. Producers of cheaper soy sauces often incorporate additional processes (thermal, chemical, or mechanical) to assist in breaking down the beans and wheat, which speeds up production. Although the fermentation process is faster, these additional processes also prevent other secondary flavors from being produced that otherwise appear in traditional methods. Those secondary flavors are, well, pretty good, so we want them. Some soy sauces are fermented in wooden barrels, adding complexity not found in more inert fermentation vessels like glass or stainless steel. When in doubt, look for Japanese soy sauces, or soy sauces made with “marudaizu” (i.e. whole beans). These soy sauces undergo longer fermentation times and therefore have additional complexity. 

Ingredients:
450 g soy sauces
50 g Mirin

Steps: 
Combine in a container and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours before using. 

Add around 35 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Lighter Shoyu Tare

When you want to keep the color of the broth lighter in appearance, use this tare. It uses a light soy sauce (usukuchi soy sauce) in place of more commonly found dark soy sauce. It isn’t as bold  as a standard shoyu tare, but it has delicious subtle flavor elements and the color is lighter.
 
Ingredients:
225 g water
225 g usukuchi soy sauce
15 g kombu
20 g niboshi
15 g katsuobushi
20 g sake
30 g mirin
30 g brown sugar
30 g salt

Steps: 
Combine the water, soy sauce, kombu, and niboshi in a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
Add the mixture to a small saucepan.
Heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Bring 180F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 
Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 °C/180 °F for 5 more minutes. 
Strain and reserve liquid on the side.
In a new clean pot, add your mirin, sake, brown sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Add this mixture to your mixture from step 9. You can store this in the fridge for up to 6 months. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup. 

Mushroom Shoyu Tare

For a vegan option, this variant is nice. The mushrooms contain guanylate, which helps improve the sensation of umami on the palate. A small addition of tamari helps round out the richness of the mushroom flavor, but is otherwise optional. 

Ingredients:
450 g soy sauce
5 g tamari (optional) 
50 g mirin
20 g dried mushrooms (such as shiitake, morel, porcini. I like to use a combination)
15 g kombu
15 g brown sugar

Steps: 
Combine the soy sauce, mirin, dried mushrooms, and kombu in a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Bring the contents to a boil.
Add the sugar, whisking to dissolve.
Remove from heat and allow the tare to cool and steep, at least 30 minutes (though you can steep for much longer)
Strain out the mushrooms, pressing on the solids to extract as much as possible. Reserve the tare as needed. Hold in the fridge for up to 6 months.

Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup. 

Black Shoyu Tare

This recipe is derived from “Toyama Black” style ramen. The original technique popularized in the region involves boiling down soy sauce until it is heavily concentrated, and then adding copious quantities of this sauce to the soup to season it. The problem with this style of tare is that it is intensely salty; too salty for most folks to drink on their own, which is why Toyama Black ramen is often accompanied by rice. This recipe accommodates this by using soy sauces that are overtly black in color from the get go, avoiding issues with balance. Resulting soups are intensely pigmented but complex. Look for Chinese soy sauces that are syrupy and deeply colored. Is this a heavily processed, artificial tare? Absolutely. But so are most tares, frankly. 

Ingredients:
225 g dark Chinese soy sauce (or tamari)
225 g soy sauce
50 g mirin
15 g dried shiitake
5 g kombu
3 g MSG (optional) 
10 g molasses

Steps: 
Combine the soy sauce, mirin, dried mushrooms, and kombu in a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Bring the contents to a boil.
Add the MSG and Molasses, whisking to dissolve.
Remove from heat and allow the tare to cool and steep, at least 30 minutes (though you can steep for much longer)
Strain out the mushrooms, pressing on the solids to extract as much as possible. Reserve the tare as needed. Hold in the fridge for up to 6 months.

Add 35 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 


Easy Meat Shoyu Tare (Aka Jiro-Style Tare)

Jiro ramen uses a pretty simple tare, where they take some cut of pork that is cooked in the broth and soak it in a sauce that eventually turns into tare. The meat seasons and can be used as chashu, and the sauce extracts some of the pork flavor while becoming the tare. I love this approach, even for shoyu, although the tare is a little sweet, so much that it isn’t as applicable to other bowls. But this approach is super convenient. 

Ingredients:
Chashu, cooked in broth until tender (see Jiro Broth Recipe for examples) 
400 g soy sauce
100 g mirin
15 g MSG

Steps:

Combine the soy sauce, mirin, and MSG in a containter
Place the chashu into the liquid, reserve in the fridge for 2 hours. 
Remove the chashu, use it for eating or other purposes. Store the tare in a sealed container for up to 2 months. 

Add 45 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Kitakata Shoyu Tare
 
This recipe comes from Shichisai, who uses extremely high-quality soy sauce that you or I probably don’t have. Just use the best soy sauce you can buy, and blend accordingly. The steps itself are incredibly simple, but this tare is less flavor-forward than other shoyu tares due to the boil and additional salt content.

Ingredients:
200 g dashi
300 g soy sauce
20 g small niboshi (such as iriko)
40 g sugar
40 g salt

Steps:

Combine the above in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil to dissolve the salt and sugar.
Once fully dissolved, allow tare to cool, then strain.
If not used immediately, store in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.  

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 
Smoked Shoyu Tare
 
I developed this recipe as part of a popup with Flat and Point. I don’t expect anyone to make it, but I’m documenting it here on the off chance you have a smoker and want to give it a shot. 

Ingredients:
300 g smoked soy sauce (add soy sauce to a pan, place in a smoker at 110 °C/225 °F, and smoke until reduced by half) 
250 g smoked mushroom liquid (smoke mushrooms in a deep pan at 110 °C/225 °F, until withered) 
50 g mirin
20 g brown sugar
15 g salt
20 g MSG

Steps:

Combine the above ingredients in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil to dissolve the salt and sugar.
Once fully dissolved, allow the tare to cool, then use it as needed.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 
Bacon Shoyu Tare
 
In the desire to remove some of the common Japanese ingredients from ramen, I decided to swap katsuobushi with bacon. The bacon dashi provides smoke and some fermented tang but does not provide inosinic acid, so some additional MSG can help. 

Ingredients:
225 g soy sauce
50 g mirin
20 g brown sugar
225 g bacon dashi 
40 g salt
5 g MSG

Steps:

Combine all ingredients in a pot.
Bring to a boil to dissolve the salt, sugar, and MSG. 
Allow tare to cool, then use it as needed. 
If not used immediately, store in the refrigerator for up to a month.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 
Mole Shoyu Tare

This is a recipe I played with on and off before my first popup at Ramen Lab. The team I worked with wanted something unique in addition to spicy. It has moderate heat, but complex chili flavors. It works excellently with chicken broth, or in tsukemen variants, but it’s a weird one for sure. The ingredient list may seem daunting but the process overall is quite simple. 

Ingredients:
70 g onion, pureed in a food processor or grated finely (around ¼ an onion)
28 g mulato chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
16 g ancho chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
22 g guajillo chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
3 g dried Chinese chilis or whole togarashi
120 g water or chicken broth from ramen
6 g chipotle powder, or 1 canned chipotle 
2 g cinnamon
0.5 g ground clove 
1 g ground cumin
5 g instant coffee granules
0.5 g dried oregano (approx ½ tsp)
6 g cocoa powder
4 g MSG
0.5 g cayenne pepper (approx ½ tsp)
150 g soy sauce
30 g brown sugar
20 g tahini


Steps: 
In a small saute pan, add the onion puree and cook with a small amount of oil over low heat, until golden brown, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, around 20-30 minutes. 
Remove the onion from the heat. 
In a separate large saute pan, toast the mulato, ancho, guajillo, and Chinese chilis over medium-high heat until fragrant, pliable, and starting to brown, around 3-5 minutes.
Cut the heat, and add the water (or broth if using), cover, and let steep for 10-15 minutes, or until the chilis are soft and reconstituted. If your pan is hot, you might need to add more water.
To the jar of a blender, add the contents from the saucepans in steps 2 and 3 with the remaining ingredients. 
Blend until the sauce has a uniform consistency. If the sauce is too thick, dilute with water as needed. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. 

Add 30g of tare per 350 mL soup, adding an additional 20 mL of soy sauce to the bottom of the bowl.

SHIO TARE RECIPES

Shio, meaning salt, is a salt-based sauce, which is meant to be more about amplifying the existing flavors of the soup than contributing other flavors. Since the base soup is unseasoned, this tare acts more as a backdrop, adding saltiness and complexity. It often contains a host of dried fish products and blends of different salt. It also, oddly enough, can contain small traces of soy sauce. Again… what are the rules even in ramen?

Shio tare is also the most difficult tare to make, given its ingredients bill. But there are alternatives. Much like the shoyu template, I find a bare-bones idea (shown below) is helpful when thinking about designing your shio tare. 
Bare Bones Shio Tare 

This template works for virtually all tares. It gives you a tare with umami and salt because it uses salt and MSG, and nothing else. On its own it adds minimal complexity; we want to highlight the qualities of the soup with shio tare, not add to it, afterall. But the tare also follows a few principles I like to make ramen by. Notably, you can use approximately 10% salt in your tare, and 6% ingredients containing glutamic acid. All shio tares can be built around these ratios. 

Ingredients:
500 g water
50 g salt
33 g MSG

Steps:

Combine the above ingredients in a saucepan, and heat to dissolve the tare.
Cover the saucepan and allow it to cool before storing indefinitely in the fridge. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 
Sake-based Shio Tare

For some additional complexity, this tare uses kombu for flavor, as well as a few other sources of subtle aromatics. Sake contains trace amounts of glutamate, adding to the umami profile, as well as a variety of other aromatics as a result of the brewing process. 

Ingredients:
400 g water
15 g kombu
50 g mirin
100 g sake
50 g salt
10 g MSG

Steps:

Combine the water, kombu, and mirin in a sealed container.
Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F and steep for 10 minutes. 
Remove the kombu and discard.
Add the sake, and bring to a boil, cooking for 10 minutes, or until the smell of alcohol subsides.
Add the salt and MSG, whisking to dissolve.
Allow tare to cool before use. Store indefinitely in the fridge. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 

White Wine Chicken Shio

This recipe is heavily adapted from a shio recipe I found some time ago in a tare book31. It’s nice, very sake and wine forward, which you may or may not like. Good for particularly chicken-forward soups, but not bad in a tonkotsu either.

Ingredients:
15 g kombu
150 g mirin
75 g sake
75 g dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
500 g chicken chintan
250 g ground chicken
100 g salt
10 g MSG

Steps:

The night before, combine the kombu, mirin, sake, and white wine in a container. Place in the fridge and steep overnight, or up to 24 hours.
When ready to make the tare, place the contents of step 1 in a saucepan and heat to 71° C/160 °F. Hold for 5 minutes.
Remove the kombu from the liquid, add in the chicken chintan and the ground chicken. Cook, mixing frequently, at a boil until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, around 5 minutes.
Strain the liquid, reserving the cooked ground chicken for another use.
Place the strained liquid back into a pot and add the salt and MSG. Cook until dissolved, whisking to incorporate, around 2-3 minutes.
Allow to cool, and store in the fridge for up to 6 months.


Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup. 
Soy/Shio Blend Tare

As mentioned earlier, some shio tare recipes contain soy sauce. There’s no way I could leave you hanging, so this is one of them. It’s effectively a blend of many tares listed above, making it a great all-purpose tare for creamy soups and light soups alike. 

Ingredients:
7 g kombu
75 g mirin
50 g sake
25 g white wine
75 g white soy sauce
25 g usukuchi soy sauce
10 g salt
5 g MSG (optional)
25 g niboshi
Sesame oil for toasting
150 g water
10 g katsuobushi

Steps:

Soak the kombu in the mirin, sake, and white wine, for at least 6 hours and up to 24, in the fridge.
When ready to make, add the kombu and steeping liquid to a saucepot. Cook on medium heat until the cooking liquid registers at 160 F degrees. Hold here for 5 minutes.
Remove the kombu, boil slightly to remove some residual alcohol, around 5 minutes.
Add the soy sauces and salts. Reserve this liquid on the side.
In the now-empty pot, add the niboshi and sesame oil to a pot. Cook until fragrant on medium-high heat, around 40 seconds.
Add the water, bring to 82 °C/180 °F.
Add the katsuobushi and steep for 10 minutes.
Strain this liquid, adding it to the one in step 4.
Combine the two strained liquids. 
Store in the fridge until ready to use. Keeps for around 6 months.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Hakodate Style Shio Tare

Arguably the originators of the shio style, Hakodate shops tend to lean into seafood’s flavor, as the city is a port town. This one uses dried scallop and dried shrimp, but niboshi or bushi is also common. (Some of these values are rounded, as I came up with this original recipe at much larger scale as part of running my ramen shop). 

Ingredients:
230 g water
20 g dried scallop
10 g dried shrimp
13 g dried konbu
66 g sake
33 g mirin
10 g MSG
60 g sea salt

Steps:

Soak the scallop, shrimp, and konbu in the water, for at least 6 hours and up to 24, in the fridge.
When ready to make, add the dried products and water to a saucepot. Cook on medium heat until the cooking liquid registers at 160 F degrees. Hold here for 5 minutes.
Remove the kombu and bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes, covered.
In a separate pot, add the sake and mirin, boil until the smell of alcohol has evaporated, around 5-10 minutes. 
Strain the konbu/seafood liquid into the pot with the sake. Discard the seafood. 
Add the MSG and Salt, bring to a boil to dissolve. 
The final yield should be 300 ml, add water back to get to this total amount. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.

MISO TARE RECIPES

Miso is the newest tare style. Miso is a common ingredient in Japan made from mashed legumes and grains (typically soybeans), plus koji, a fungus with enzymes that convert protein and starches in legumes into complex flavor compounds. Technically, miso can use any sort of protein-rich source (my friend Rich made miso once with ricotta cheese!). The use of miso in ramen originates from Sapporo in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan, and was invented in the mid-1950s, in a small shop named Aji no Sanpei, whose chef fed hungry workers by adding noodles to a pork miso soup. Or so the lore goes.

It is my favorite style of tare, and the tare I have spent the most time on. In many ways, the following recipe is my most important one. 
Ramen_Lord’s Miso Tare

After more than 10 years of tweaking and experimenting with miso tare, here’s my take. It’s very miso forward. If you don’t like your miso so forward in the flavor of the final dish, you can cook the tare in a saucepan or wok for 5-10 minutes over medium heat. Doing so releases volatile compounds in the miso (of which there are many32). 

Ingredients:
140 g raw onion pureed in a food processor, or grated finely (around one half of an onion)
7 g garlic, grated (around 2 cloves)
6 g ginger, grated (around a 1-inch piece)
300 g white miso (I use Yamabuki Shinshu) 
180 g tezukuri or mugi miso (I use Yamabuki Tezukuri) 
80 g hatcho style miso
20 g mirin
30 g soy sauce
5 g sesame oil
14 g tahini or nerigoma
1 g black pepper (or around 20 grinds from a pepper mill)
2 g tobanjan (or Chinese doubanjiang) 
pinch of white pepper
pinch of togarashi or cayenne 

Steps:
Take 70 g of the raw onion puree, and add to a small pan. 
Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, around 20-30 minutes.
Remove from heat, place the cooked onion in a mixing bowl.
When the onion has cooled, add all remaining other ingredients. Use a whisk to combine. 
Place in the fridge in a covered container and allow the tare to mature for at least 24 hours to better develop the flavor and remove some of the harshness from the raw vegetables. The tare will keep for up to 12 months. 

Add 60-70 g of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Kara Miso (Spicy Miso) 

This recipe is a variant of the standard miso approach but uses additional ingredients to highlight the actual pepper flavor, rather than merely adding spice. 

Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper, deseeded
2 habanero chilies, deseeded
140 g onion, pureed in a food processor
7 g garlic, grated/minced
6 g ginger, grated/minced
300 g white miso
180 g Tezukuri or mugi miso
80 g red miso
10 g mirin
30 g soy sauce
5 g sesame oil
14 g tahini
8 g Tobanjan
60 g Gochujang
0.5 g smoked paprika (approx ½ tsp)
1 tbsp togarashi (this is for flavor, we’re also adding spice to the bottom of the bowl)

Steps:
Blend the red bell pepper, deseeded habaneros in a food processor until fully pureed and liquidy.
Combine with half of the large onion pulp (about ¼ of an onion).
Add this liquidy paste to a small saucepan or skillet, and cook over medium heat, until the majority of the water has evaporated and begins to caramelize, around 10-15 minutes.
Add the contents from step 2 to a bowl. Combine with the remaining ingredients. Whisk fully to incorporate. This tare will keep for up to 12 months.

Add 70 g of tare per 350 mL soup. 

Sweet Miso Tare (For Akayu Style Bowls) 

The tare is a cooked miso tare, with a relatively low miso flavor as a result, the cooking process sending off volatile flavor compounds. The goal here is to cook out the alcohol, and most of the fruitiness of the miso. This is, ironically, much easier to do at home than it is in bigger quantity. So, yay for us home cooks! 

Since the miso is cooked, feel free to buy sub-par miso for this. We’re not as much interested In nuanced miso complexity (like we are with my more standard Miso tare). 

Ingredients:
125 g white miso
125 g red miso
25 g mirin
50 g sake
25 g soy sauce
10 g tahini
6 g salt
6 g MSG
15 ml vegetable oil
Pinch Black pepper
Pinch of Togarashi

Steps:
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. 
Add to a nonstick skillet, and cook, over medium low heat, until the smell of alcohol evaporates, and the paste turns thicker in texture, around 15-20 minutes.
Allow to cool, then transfer to a container to store in the fridge. Reserve indefinitely in the fridge.

Add 60 g of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Other Tares 

Some tares don’t quite fall into the above categories, due to their ingredient composition. These alternatives are listed below. 

Tantanmen Tare

Tantanmen, derived from dan dan noodles from China, is a sesame and spice based dish. This method is extremely simple, but feel free to incorporate other common ingredients, such as Sichuan pickles. Ironically, this tare rarely contains large quantities of umami-building ingredients, but it’s still delicious. 

Ingredients (for one bowl): 

35 g soy sauce
3 g rice wine vinegar
25 g ground sesame (either tahini or nerigoma)

Steps:
Combine the above ingredients, whisking until fully incorporated, at the bottom of a serving bowl. You can, alternatively, up the amount by scaling the amounts as needed. 

“Hot” Tare

I had been tasked with designing a spicy ramen that didn’t pivot too directly into Miso flavors. Opting to use more Korean ingredients, the final tare has subtle pepper flavors and good heat, without overwhelming the specific flavor of the soup you’re using. 

Ingredients:
300 g water
100 g  soy sauce
6 g MSG
60 g salt
90 g gochujang
10 g fine Korean pepper powder
10 g garlic cloves
15 g Thai bird Chilis
50 g Mirin

Steps:
Combine the above ingredients in a blender. Blend on high for 30 seconds or until smooth. 
Reserve in the fridge for up to a week. 

Add 45 ml of tare per 300 mL soup. 

Muroran Curry Tare

I developed this recipe as a special in February 2024 for Akahoshi Ramen. Loosely based on a video I stumbled upon from NHK, it uses a combination of spices and vegetables to promote thickening and flavor. This makes a large amount of tare (easily 30 portions), so scale down as needed. 

Ingredients:
Spices: 

2 tbsp 15 g coriander seed (2 tbsp) 
15 g cumin seeds (1.5 tbsp) 
10 g brown mustard seeds (1.5 tbsp) 
10g black peppercorns (1 tbsp) 
7 cloves, whole (< 1 g)
10 g white pepper (2 tsp)
25 g cardamom (3 tbsp)
20 g togarashi (2 tbsp)
6 g ground cinnamon (2 tsp)
10 g ground Tumeric (purely for color) (1 tbsp)
4 g grated nutmeg (1 tsp) 
40 g S&B curry. (3 tbsp)

Vegetables: 

4 onions (~1000 g onion), peeled, cut into pieces
1 cup garlic cloves (~200 g)
½ cup peeled ginger (~100 g), cut into pieces
4 small apples (gala or fuji), peeled, cored, cut into pieces (~350 g)
1 large russet potato, peeled, cut into pieces (~250g)
Vegetable oil
200 g salt
150 g MSG

Steps:
Toast the coriander, cumin, brown mustard seeds, black peppercorns, and cloves in a small saute pan for 1-2 minutes over medium heat, until aromatic. 
Grind the spices, then combine with the white pepper, cardamom, togarashi, cinnamon, turmeric, nutmeg, and curry powder. Set spice mix aside
Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, apples, and potato in a high-powered blender, blend into a fine puree. You may need to do this in batches. 
Add the puree to a large pot with a splash of vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then cover, drop the temperature to low, and cook for 1 hour, stirring regularly to prevent scorching. This mixture may turn blue as it cooks, this is normal and expected. 
Add the spices, salt, and MSG, cook for another hour. Continue to stir regularly. 
Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge until needed. 

Add 60 ccs of tare to 350 ml of soup in a pot. Bring to a vigorous boil before serving.

CHAPTER 4: TOPPINGS


Toppings, like with many other components of ramen, depend on the goal of the dish. Toppings can enhance the existing flavors in the dish or contrast with them. They can provide textural contrast or can easily blend into the soup, providing additional flavor notes. We can imagine that topics have a ton of versatility if they can fit so many different characteristics. And because they can be so diverse, there’s plenty of room for innovation and experimentation. In this chapter, we’ll cover a handful of common toppings used in ramen, as well as ingredients and steps to make them. 

Steeped Egg 
A soft-cooked egg with just a bit of seasoning, the yolk, gooey and liquid, spilling into the broth, with a firm, fully cooked white.

There’s a way to predict just how quickly the egg will season, but the math behind it is rigorous. Even Scott was scratching his head for a little bit (and still is). Luckily, the final formula is pretty simple. The length of the diffusion layer for a three-dimensional object is described by:


Here, L is the depth of the diffusion layer, D is the diffusion coefficient (in m2/s), and t is the time (in seconds). In this case, D is a material property of the egg, the solution, and the temperature, which is best determined by experiment. The important takeaway is that time is related to the square of the seasoning’s distance into the egg. This means that a full cure will take longer than you might intuitively think. If it takes 1 hour for the brine to penetrate the egg white 1 mm, it will take 4 hours to penetrate 2 mm, and 9 hours to penetrate just 3 mm. This means that it can be pretty difficult to overseason the egg unless your brine is particularly salty, and that brining is often an exercise in waiting more than careful timing. 

Ingredients:
High-quality chicken eggs (large is good)
Water
Ice

Steps:

Bring a large pot of water to a full boil.
In a large bowl or container, fill with ice and cold water to make an ice bath. Reserve. 
Remove eggs from the refrigerator. 
Optionally, using a thumbtack or the heel of a knife, poke a small hole or divot in the bottom of the wider side of the egg.
This step has the benefit of allowing the albumen to expand in the shell, preventing cracking, and helps with the overall shape of the egg. It’s optional, but if you’re having trouble with eggs cracking, or having eggs that are hard to peel, this step can help. 
Working in batches of 4-6 eggs at a time, to avoid the water temperature dropping too quickly. lower your eggs into the boiling water.
Boil the eggs, stirring occasionally during the first minute or so of cooking, for 6-7 minutes, depending on how firm you’d like the yolk. I like 7, the yolk gets juuuust a tad cooked, and slightly custardy. Others like a completely liquid yolk, which is around 6 minutes to 6 minutes 30 seconds. 
After the time is up, quickly remove the eggs from the water and place them in the ice bath from step 2, hold for 15 minutes, or until thoroughly chilled. 
This process, called shocking, prevents additional carry-over cooking (the exterior of the egg is much hotter than the interior), making sure the white is fully cooked without allowing the yolk to cook more than necessary. 
Peel, then proceed with the steeping method below. 

Steeping Method One: Quick and Easy Brine
This is the generally accepted approach for eggs in most Japanese kitchens. 

Ingredients:
One part soy sauce
One part mirin
One part water

So for 300 mL of brine, use 100 mL of each ingredient. How much brine you want to make is totally up to you.

Steps:
Place peeled eggs in an airtight container, like a hard plastic container or a sealable bag.
Pour the above ingredients into the container to cover (you may not need to use all the brine, reduce the amount as necessary) 
Soak, jostling contents every hour or so, for 4-6 hours. 
Remove from brine, reserve in the fridge until needed. 

Steeping Method 2: Equilibrium Brine 
Ingredients:
Water
Soy sauce 
Mirin

Steps: 
In the container you will also soak the eggs in, weigh your peeled eggs. Add water to cover completely, and record the total weight of the eggs and water. 
Add in 10% of this weight in soy sauce, and 8% in mirin. 
Soak in the fridge for at least 24 hours, and reserve in the brine until needed. Anywhere from 1-3 days.


Chashu
Alongside eggs, chashu is perhaps the other most common topping for ramen. Chashu is almost always a slow-cooked slice of pork, usually from either the belly or the shoulder, but it can also be from the loin for leaner variants. There are several approaches to making chashu: 

Several shops cook the pork in broth and boil it until tender, usually 2-3 hours. Then they reserve it in a sauce (or tare) of some kind.
Some shops perform a braise, tossing the pork into a tare directly and boiling until cooked. Then this tare gets used for other dishes. 
Some shops just straight-up roast their pork, for that excellent caramelized flavor.
More sophisticated shops often use sous vide, or temperature-controlled water baths, for optimal precision.

All of these techniques have their pros and cons: 

Technique
Pros
Cons
Cook in Soup
Requires very little setup; No additional pots needed
Adds flavor to soup
Can’t add salt before cooking
Typically the most boring-flavor wise
Prone to overcooking
Braise in Tare
Flavorful
Relatively easy
Familiar technique to most home cooks
Some monitoring required
Dry Roasting
Flavorful
Familiar to most cooks
Messy
Unable to add certain flavors
Prone to overcooking
Sous Vide
Most control
Most consistent product
Great color
Best flavor
Most time consuming
Equipment can be expensive



How you finish the chashu is also a common point of contention. Searing, reheating, throwing the slices into the soup cold, you can do whatever you like with whatever combination you desire. It’ll probably be delicious no matter how you finish preparing the meat, but I recommend making sure the pieces you use are similar in size. That’ll make the presentation and cooking much more consistent. 

Cook in Soup 

Take your belly or shoulder, and toss it into your simmering/boiling broth. Tie it, keep it loose, whatever you like, just put it in your broth when it begins to bubble, and after you’ve skimmed any scum. 

Then, cook in the broth until tender, anywhere from 2-3 hours. Remove the pork when you feel it is sufficiently cooked (for a melty piece of meat, I prefer around 203F, though anything above 190 F will be very tender), and place in the Easy Meat Shoyu Tare, and allow to soak in the fridge for 2-4 hours. This seasons the pork, your tare, AND adds porky goodness to your soup. It’s not complex, but some styles, like Jiro ramen, hinge on this approach. It can also be beneficial for tonkotsu, which needs fat and collagen to achieve the proper soup look and feel. 

Standard Braise 

This is often how I make chashu. The pork is really tender, to the point that it actually becomes difficult to pick up with chopsticks, so if you’re into that extremely luscious texture, this method is for you. You can mix things up by adding green onion, ginger, garlic, or other aromatics to your braising liquid, but I’ve always kept it simple. 

Ingredients:
Pork belly or shoulder (weight is not important here)
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
125 mL (½ cup) mirin
125 mL (½ cup) soy sauce
250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
12.5 g (approx. 1 tbsp) brown sugar
60 mL (approx. ¼ cup) sake
Three garlic cloves, smashed

Steps: 
Preheat your oven to 110 °C/225 °F. 
Heat a large, oven-safe vessel that you can sear in over medium heat. Cast iron or an enameled dutch oven works great here, but any oven-safe pot or pan will work
Season the exterior of the pork with salt and pepper on all sides. 
Place the pork in the heated pan and sear on all sides until golden brown, around 4-5 minutes per side. 
Some fat will render as the pork cooks. With a paper towel, sop up residual fat. 
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mirin, soy sauce, water, and brown sugar. Stir to dissolve the brown sugar. Then add the garlic. At this stage, you could also add other aromatics like ginger, or green onion. 
Deglaze the pan with the sake, then add in the ingredients from step 6. 
Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the vessel. 
Place the vessel into the oven, and braise, occasionally turning the pork every hour or so, until the pork is quite tender, and the internal temperature reaches around  93 °C/200 °F. 
Remove, allow to cool, then place in the fridge with the cooking liquid, and chill to allow for easy slicing. 

Dry Roasting

In some shops, the pork is hung in a small chimney like charcoal or gas grills until it is cooked. Despite the name “chashu” roughly referring to Chinese roast pork, the actual act of dry roasting chashu is relatively rare. But it can be delicious. 

In dry roasting, some precaution needs to be taken into account to avoid over-cooking the meat. Unlike in a water-based cooking method, where the temperature never gets above boiling, dry roasting can quickly get portions of the meat past the temperature where connective tissue breaks down before the collagen has time to turn into gelatin, resulting in dry, chalky meat, that is essentially ruined. 

To compensate, chashu needs to be roasted at a lower temperature for a very long time, upwards of 5-6 hours. Meat cooked this way is never tender the way a braised piece of meat is, but it has deep, intense, caramelized notes on the exterior of the meat. 

The method is effectively the same for pork belly or shoulder. Use whichever cut you prefer.

Ingredients:
Pork belly
Seasoning (typically, salt, and pepper, followed by a glaze of some kind, typically soy sauce-based) 

Steps:
Preheat the oven to 150 °C/300 °F
On a baking sheet with a wire rack set in it, add the pork belly and season generously. 
Roast until the interior of the meat reaches 91 °C/195 °F, anywhere from 5-10 hours depending on the size of the roast. 
Remove the pork, increase the heat of the oven to 230 °C/450 °F
When the oven has come to the higher temperature, coat the pork in the glaze, and roast for 5-10 minutes or until caramelized and seared to your liking. 

Sous Vide 

Sous vide is an incredible tool for chashu. It allows you to produce meat that is both exceptionally tender, well structured, and gorgeously pink, while still being fully cooked and safe to eat. This is a fantastic way to make chashu, and most high-end shops are pivoting to this approach, because it allows them to cook with marvelous consistency.

It also allows you to store the pork in the bag well in advance before use. Simply remove the bag from the water bath, chill the bag in an ice bath, and then reserve in the fridge. This pork should keep well for several weeks, provided you keep it in the vacuum-sealed bag, as the pork itself will be pasteurized and won’t be exposed to oxygen. 

The cooking liquid is practically identical to what was used in the braising recipe. 

Ingredients:
Pork belly (weight is not important here)
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) mirin
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
250 mL (approx.1 cup) water
12.5 g (1 tbsp) brown sugar
60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
Ice water for shocking

Steps:
Preheat a water bath to 79 °C/175 °F using a sous vide water circulator.
Sear the pork belly on all sides on high heat in a pan until golden brown, then place in a sturdy bag (ideally one used for a vacuum sealer). 
Deglaze the pan with the remaining ingredients, then reserve this liquid and allow it to cool.
When the liquid has cooled, add it to the bag with the pork. 
Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible.
Cook the pork belly sous vide for 7-12 hours. 
Remove the meat from the bath, and add to the ice water to chill quickly. Reserve in the fridge until needed, then slice as desired. 

Now, you can select many temperatures and times based on preference. I like chashu to be pretty melty, but still with some structure so that it doesn’t fall apart in the chopsticks, so I sous vide at a relatively high temperature. Others may prefer a more steak-like, or firm chashu. Lower temperatures (say, 68 °C/155 °F) for a longer period (24-36 hours) will give a more steaky texture if that’s what you’re looking for.

“Rare” Chashu 

In the past 10 years, chashu has evolved to be more than simply cooked pork shoulder. 

Techniques like sous vide have rapidly improved our ability to cook and eat pork products in unique and often otherwise impossible ways. Chefs in Japan use sous vide to cook pieces of pork until they are just barely cooked, around 57 °C/135 °F or so, then chilling thoroughly before slicing. Hence the name “rare” chashu. It’s legit rare pork, taking on the color of something like rare roast beef. 

I’ve found, admittedly, that this concept is pretty hard for most Americans to get behind, especially with American pork. The texture is somewhere between steak-like and ham, and the color is very pink, which some Americans would say is undercooked. That doesn’t mean it’s unsafe though. The odds of getting trichinosis, the main pathogen in undercooked pork, is very low 34. The CDC reports less than 20 cases yearly, in large part due to extensive safety precautions taken by meat manufacturers, effectively eliminating it as a safety measure. The USDA as a result has lowered the required temperature of pork products to 63 °C/145 °F. Realistically you can probably go lower, and to get rare chashu, a lower temperature is required. Just as a reminder, food safety relies on temperature and exposure time. Sous vide allows for control of both with maximum precision, leading to fully cooked pieces of pork that are, well, unusual to the uninitiated.

Texture-wise, it’s a completely different product than what’s normally used as a topping; the well-done pork I described earlier. It needs to be thinly sliced to account for the lack of collagen breakdown. And it can quickly go from pink to grey if it sits in the hot soup for too long, as the pork effectively cooks more. Rare chashu also often uses different cuts of pork than more traditional chashu. Unlike well-done chashu, which uses belly or a standard shoulder roast, rare chashu most often uses a specific cut of the shoulder typically called the “coppa.” In the world of BBQ, this cut is called, “the tubes.”  Other names include the CT Butt, the top of the shoulder, or even the so-called “pork neck” muscle. No matter the name, this is a section of the shoulder that runs the furthest from the large bone you typically find in a pork shoulder and is heavily marbled with fat in between circular, tube-shaped muscle groups. 

That’s not to suggest that rare chashu must use the coppa. Practically, rare chashu can be made from any cut of nicely marbled shoulder, but traditionally the tubes are used to get the quintessential round look seen in shops. 

Ingredients:
Pork coppa or pork shoulder
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) mirin
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
13 g (1 tbsp) brown sugar
60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
Ice water for shocking

Steps:
(optional) Using butcher’s twine, tie the pork into a round shape. 
Preheat a water bath to 57 °C/135 °F using a sous vide water circulator.
Sear the pork belly on all sides on high heat in a pan until golden brown, then place in a sturdy bag (ideally one used for a vacuum sealer). 
Deglaze the pan with the remaining ingredients, then reserve this liquid and allow it to cool.
When the liquid has cooled, add it to the bag with the pork. 
Remove as much of the air from the bag as possible. Use either a vacuum sealer or the water in the immersion circulator to push out the air before sealing the bag.
Cook the pork belly for 2-3 hours. 
Remove the meat from the bath, and shock in ice water to chill quickly. Reserve in the fridge until needed, then slice as desired. 

Combination Method: Braise then Roast

As I was writing this book, I wondered, why not combine some of the approaches to get the ideal results for each? I love the deeply caramelized exterior of roasted pork but hate how much you have to babysit it. And I love the melty quality of a braised piece of meat but hated how it lacked true roasted flavor. The term “chashu” is derived from Cantonese style BBQ pork after all. This method, therefore, combines both approaches, to get succulent meat, and a delicious, charred exterior. 

Since the pork sits out of the braising liquid while the oven preheats, the surface gradually becomes dry and slightly tacky from the sugar, causing the surface to caramelize very quickly. A quick blast in the oven is all it takes. 

Ingredients:
Pork belly (I find this method is less successful with shoulder) 
60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) mirin
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
25 g (approx. 2 tbsp) brown sugar
60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
Three garlic cloves, smashed

Steps: 
Add all ingredients to a saucepan large enough to hold the pork, but small enough to allow for the pork to be submerged.
Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the vessel. 
Continue to cook the pork at a simmer until tender, or the internal temperature registers above 95 °C/203 °F, around 2-3 hours (though the thickness of your pork belly will increase this cooking time). When in doubt, probe the pork belly to make sure the texture is appropriate, it should be soft, yielding, and jiggly.  
Remove the pork and place it on a wire rack set in a baking sheet. Reserve the liquid in a container of your choice that will be big enough to hold the pork as well. 
Preheat your oven as high as it goes (the hotter the better), for at least 30 minutes. This gives the pork time to dry, to cool, and ensures the oven is hot sufficiently to char the surface when the pork goes in.
When the oven is heated, Place the pork in the oven and roast for 5-10 minutes, or until the exterior of the pork is dark, rusted, and bubbling.  
Remove the pork from the oven. Place the hot pork back into the braising liquid in the container. Allow to cool the room temperature, then let chill overnight in the fridge before slicing. 

Sous Vide Chicken Breast

Unlike my opinion on sous vide pork, which often teeters back and forth preference and dislike, I prefer using sous vide when cooking chicken breast for ramen. 

For one, chicken breast is probably the most misunderstood and disrespected meat of all time. Widely available in supermarkets, most cooked chicken breast is either too dry or under seasoned. Many home cooks have avoided this cut entirely for fattier dark meat pieces like thigh or drumsticks, and for good reason. They’re usually far easier to cook and often result in far more palatable dishes. 

Sous vide takes all of the careful measurement and delicate process control away, fixing the cooking temperature with precision. Overcooking chicken with sous vide goes from being a frequent problem for home cooks to a total nonissue. And, like with rare pork, you can cook chicken breast at lower temperatures than with conventional cooking while still producing a safely cooked product. The USDA recommends heating all poultry to 74 °C/ 165 °F, but that’s assuming a short exposure time. What does chicken taste like that’s been cooked to a lower temperature, oh, say, 63 °C/145 °F (assuming you adjust the cooking time appropriately)? Good. Real good. That I can assure you. 

Here is my preferred method for chicken breasts. It’s extremely versatile, feel free to add herbs, other spices, or seasonings like soy sauce or mirin, to the bag. 

Ingredients:
Chicken breast
Salt to taste
Ice water for shocking
Pepper (optional)
Other seasonings (optional) 

Steps:
Preheat a water bath to 63 °C/145 °F using a sous vide water circulator (or whichever temperature you prefer, to me 63 °C/145 °F is extremely supple, juicy, and tender). 
Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, making sure to cover the breasts evenly.
Place the chicken breasts in a sturdy bag ideally one used for a vacuum sealer or a sealable bag.
Remove as much of the air from the bag as possible. Use either a vacuum sealer or the water in the immersion circulator to push out the air before sealing the bag.
Cook for 2 hours (or up to 4) to ensure pasteurization. 
Remove from the water bath, slice as desired. If not using immediately, chill the breasts quickly via an ice bath, and store in the fridge until needed. 


GREEN ONIONS
I think green onions are the most important topping in ramen. You have a few options with how you prepare your green onions:

ringlets: slice the scallion into small rings, typically as thin as you can get them. The goal of this cut is to have the green onions be so thin that they give almost no texture to the bowl. You can use the green or the white or both for this application. 
oblong diamonds: a more western technique, slicing the green onions at a 45-degree angle gives the resulting shape a diamond-like appearance. 
threads: you can also slice the green onion lengthwise. Cut the green onion into 3-inch pieces, rotate, and slide into threads. The layers of the green onion will help you achieve this, and it’s easier with the white part of the green onion. 
fine dice: After creating threads along the length of the onion, you can slice the green onion further into small dice. This looks nice when added with the tare, giving the surface of the soup a speckled appearance. 


MENMA
The reality is that menma in the US is hard to make. Menma requires a specific type of bamboo that has been dried and lacto-fermented. These are effectively unavailable to home cooks (though some restaurant distributors do sell them in bulk). 

If you can get your hands on these, the process is also somewhat annoying, but doable. Otherwise, some asian supermarkets sell prepared menma.

Ingredients:
500 g lacto fermented bamboo shoots
100 g mirin
15 g sugar
20 g soy sauce
Sesame oil, as needed

Steps: 
The night before, submerge the bamboo to a bowl of cold water and allow them to soak in the fridge for 12-24 hours.
Drain the bamboo thoroughly, set aside.
In a saute pan, add your bamboo, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce. 
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is slightly absorbed, 10-15 minutes.
Add the sesame oil to coat.
Transfer the menma to a container and allow them to soak for 24 hours. The menma will keep over time. 

Note: you may find some additional “quick” methods for making menma with canned bamboo. At this time, I don't have a recipe I think is a sufficient substitute for the real stuff. 


ROASTED TOMATO
This method is blatantly stolen from the legendary Ivan Orkin24, who used this topping to great effect in his shio ramen in Japan. It’s delicious, and a great alternative for an umami-laden ingredient. 

Ingredients:
Tomatoes (I like Roma tomatoes, but any tomato you like will work) 
Salt
Pepper
Olive Oil

Steps: 
Preheat your oven to 121 °C/ 225 °F. 
Slice the tops and bottoms off of the tomato, then slice the tomato in half lengthwise (so that you have two round, fat disks of tomato). 
Place the tomato on a baking sheet, season with salt, pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. 
Roast the tomatoes until they are plush, withered, and have shrunk in size, around 2-3 hours. 


WOOD EAR MUSHROOM
This is a common topping in southern-style paitan soups, particularly tonkotsu. It is bafflingly easy to make. They’re primarily for texture contrast, as they have little to no flavor. 

Ingredients:
Dried wood ear mushrooms
Water

Steps: 
Cover the dried wood ear mushrooms with boiling water.
Allow to steep for 15 minutes, or until rehydrated.
Strain and reserve as needed. You can optionally cut into thin strips if desired. 


BOILED SPINACH

Boiling spinach is not hard, and it’s also a common topping, particularly in shoyu. Since the soup is often amply seasoned, I find the water used for cooking here does not need salt. Feel free to add it if you so choose. 

Ingredients:
Spinach (ideally with root attached) 
Water for boiling
Ice water for shocking

Steps: 
Bring the water to a boil in a large pot/.
Add the spinach, starting from the root end. Cook for 20-30 seconds.
Strain spinach and transfer to ice water to stop cooking.
Wring out the spinach of its residual water, shaping it into a firm log.
Cut the log into 2-inch pieces, then reserve as needed. 


PORK SOBORO
Soboro is a common ramen topping in tantanmen, but it’s also great over rice, stuffed into lettuce wraps, or on its own with a spoon, if you’re feeling extra gluttonous. 

Ingredients:
15 mL (approx 1 tbsp) vegetable oil
Half of one white onion, diced finely
0.5 kg ground pork (or around 1 lb)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2  0.5-cm/0.25-in coins of ginger, minced
30 mL (approx. 2 tbsp) soy sauce
45 mL (approx. 3 tbsp) sweet bean paste
15 mL (approx. 1 tbsp) mirin
15 mL (approx. 1 tbsp) sake
salt to taste

Steps:

In a large saute pan, sweat the onion over medium heat in the oil until translucent, 3-5 minutes.
Increase the heat to high, and add in the pork. Cook, stirring and breaking up clumps, until starting to brown.
Add in the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, around 1 minute.
Add in remaining ingredients. Cook until the pork is glossy, fully cooked, and flavorful. Adjust seasonings as necessary. 

Method modification: The above can be treated almost like a bolognese. After adding the ingredients in step 4, transfer the mixture to a low oven, partially covered, and cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally and scraping down brown bits. The resulting meat mixture is much more “sauce” like in this application, and takes on notable roasted flavors. 


SPICE BLEND
I don’t know whether this counts as a “topping” or not. I like to add it both to the bottom of the bowl and also on top of the soup after the noodles have been added. Will the ramen gods forsake me for mischaracterizing a spice blend? Eh, maybe I’m overthinking it. 

In any case, heat comes in several forms in ramen. You can add chili oil, togarashi powder (ground Japanese chilis), or fermented pastes like Gochujang and Tobanjan. I like to make a blend of spices for spicier variants of ramen. Below is a standard spice blend I use:

Ingredients

8 dried Chinese chilies, whole
6 g togarashi (approx 2 tbsp) 
3 g whole Sichuan peppercorns (approx. 1 tbsp) 
Optional: 2 g white peppercorns (approx. 2 tsp) 

Steps:
In a spice mill, blend the above ingredients one by one. Combine in a small bowl. Reserve until needed. 


AKAYU SPICY MISO BALL
This is a recipe derived from a topping created by a shop called Ryushanhai in the Yamagata prefecture of Japan in 1960. It’s meant to top Akayu style bowls of ramen, but can be used in a host of other applications, especially if you’re a glutton for spice. I can’t say that this will be 100% in line with the style, but it has noticeable heat, and is fun to slowly stir into the soup as you consume it. Don’t worry too much about the quality of the miso you use here, it’s mostly for body and salt, and acts as a backdrop to the primary flavors of garlic and spice. 

Ingredients

80 g garlic
40 g Thai Bird Chilis (other fresh red chilis would also work here)
5 g Vegetable oil
Optional: 3 g Fish Powder
60 g White Miso
60 g brown miso
10 g fine Korean Chili powder (add more for more heat)

Steps:
Combine the garlic and chilis in the bowl of a food processor. Process until a fine paste.
Add the paste to a skillet with the oil, and cook over medium heat, until the garlic’s pungency has subsided considerably, and the vegetables have released most of their moisture, around 5 minutes
Add the fish powder if using, bloom it with the chili and garlic mixture over medium heat, around 1 minute. 
Combine the garlic/chili paste with the remaining ingredients. 

Use around 30-40 g per bowl (but personal preference rules here)

Chapter 5: Aroma Oil

Aroma oil, the unsung hero of ramen. 

Why is it essential?
Fat often dissolves compounds not otherwise dispersed in the soup. These compounds are often volatile and release when heated within an oily solution. The oil’s design here is to provide an additional level of aromatic quality, hence the name. 

Aroma oil is sort of a new addition in several respects. Normally, aromatic oil was derived from the soup making process. Vegetables floating on the surface of the bubbling broth infused the rendered fat from chicken or pork bones used to make the base soup. Cooks now infuse the fat more carefully or add additional fat on top of the fat that is rendered during the soup making process. 

Most aroma oils take the same standard approach. Take fat and aromatics and bring them to the point that the aromatics sizzle. You can push this more and allow them to brown, or not, your choice, but then remove from the heat and allow the aromatics to steep in the fat until cool. Then strain and reserve as needed. 


=============================================================================
=============================================================================
=============================================================================
AROMA OIL RECIPES

CHICKEN FAT 

Many of the recipes here call for some sort of animal fat as the aroma oil. Chicken fat, sometimes called, “schmaltz” is made from the skin most frequently. It’s surprisingly easy to make. I’ve included two methods.

Stovetop Method 

Ah, the stovetop method. This one’s pretty traditional. Most amateurs think they need to render fat at high temperatures, right on the pan, but that actually isn’t necessary. Fats render at lower temperatures than you might think, as we’re really shooting for their melting point. We also don’t want to brown the skin, because we’re just looking for mildly flavored fats that we can add flavor to later. Intuitively, you can avoid browning by putting a ceiling on the maximum temperature your product can reach. Water makes for a pretty good ceiling, as you can’t get much more hot than the boiling point. It also conducts heat pretty well. So for a traditional fat extraction technique, I render fat from chicken skin in water.

Ingredients:
Chicken skin
15-30 g water

Steps:
Add the skin and the water to a pan and heat, over medium heat. You can omit it if you’d like the additional flavor browning provides. You can basically cook this forever as long as you replace the water, killing the heat and allowing the fat to separate after 45 minutes or so.
However, if you want additional browning flavor, don’t add any additional water, and cook the water off and allow the skins to fry in their own fat, allowing the skins to take on a golden brown color. Cook for approximately 45 minutes.
Strain and reserve the crispy skins as desired. 
If not using the oil immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. 


LARD 

Lard is available at most grocery stores. However, should you desire, you can also render pork fat to make lard at home. I find that purchasing even poor quality lard is sufficient for most purposes since we sort of want that piggy-flavor in most applications. But you do you. 

Ingredients:
2 lb backfat (or other fat-laden pork parts) 
15-30 g water

Steps:
Preheat an oven to 121 °C/250 °F.
Add fatback and water to an oven-safe pan.
Cook in the oven for 2-3 hours, or until the fatback has turned golden brown and rendered fully. 
Strain and reserve the fat as needed. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. 


ALL-PURPOSE NEGI (SCALLION) OIL

If this is your first exposure to aroma oil, this is an easy way to see how the process works, and it’s versatile for several ramen styles without requiring any complex ingredients. It works on lighter bowls and more rich ones. As a bonus, you can use this stuff in all sorts of dishes. Fried rice, sear chicken in it, toss it with a salad. All tasty. 

Ingredients:
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) neutral oil, like vegetable oil
One bunch of scallion whites, trimmed of their ends. 

Steps: 
In a small saucepan, add the oil and scallions. 
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the scallions take on a light golden hue and smell fragrant around 10-15 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot and allow it to cool. 
Strain and transfer oil to a melt-resistant container. If not used immediately, store in the fridge for up to 6 months. 


CHICKEN AND SCALLION OIL

This aroma oil is really nice for ramen bowls that are light in their richness. 

Ingredients:
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered chicken fat
One bunch of scallion whites, trimmed of their ends and cut into 2-inch pieces
4 garlic cloves

Steps: 
In a small saucepan, add the oil, scallions, and garlic cloves. 
Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the scallions take on a light golden hue and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot, and allow it to cool. 
Strain and transfer to a container. If not used immediately, store in the fridge. 

NEGI NIBOSHI OIL

This is awesome on bowls with shoyu tares, or soups with fish-forward characteristics like the ”Cement” ramen soup. 

Ingredients:
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered chicken fat
5 whole scallions, trimmed of ends and cut into 2-inch pieces
10 medium-sized niboshi. 

Steps: 
In a small saucepan, add the oil, scallions, and niboshi. 
Heat over medium to medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the scallions and niboshi take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot and allow to cool. 
Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months.

GINGER AND ONION LARD 

I particularly like this one for miso variants, though it’s good on shoyu too. 

Ingredients:
125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered pork lard
One half white onion, cut into large pieces
4 garlic cloves
One one-inch piece of ginger, peeled, sliced into 0.5 cm/0.25 in coins. 

Steps:
In a small saucepan, add the oil, onion, garlic, and ginger. 
Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot, and allow it to cool. 
Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. 

CELERY SEED OIL

The celery seed in this oil boosts the flavor of chicken, giving bowls a western flavor that I particularly like in Paitan. 

Ingredients:
250 mL (approx. 1 cup) rendered chicken fat
One half white onion, cut into fine dice
1.5 tbsp celery seeds

Steps: 
In a small saucepan, add the fat, onion, and celery seeds
Heat over medium to medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions take on a light golden hue, and the oil smells fragrant, around 15 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot and allow to cool. 
Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months.

CHILI OIL

Chili oil is a relative newcomer to the ramen world, usually used in Chinese-flavor inspired ramen dishes like tantanmen, but it’s definitely in line with what I’d consider an aroma oil. I like to use animal fats in mine and combine them with some aromatics, but you can use any variants you like. This is classically used in tantanmen, but is also good for adding some nice chili flavor and heat to other kinds of ramen.

Ingredients:
250 mL (approx. 1 cup) fat of choice (I typically use pork lard, though vegetable oil also works here) 
8 cloves garlic
1 5-cm/2-in piece of ginger, sliced into  0.5 cm/0.25 in coins
Half of a small onion
3 tbsp coarsely ground togarashi 
4 dried Chinese chilis
1-2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns

Steps:
In a small saucepan, add the fat, garlic, ginger, and onion.
Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes. 
Add in your togarashi, Chinese chilis, and Sichuan peppercorns. 
Remove the saucepan from the heat, and let the ingredients steep in this oil for 30 minutes. 
Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. 


MAYU
Mayu is a very dark, almost black, aroma oil commonly used in southern-style tonkotsu based ramen, particularly from the Kumamoto region. It achieves this look from finely ground cooked vegetables that are used, not from the oil necessarily. It has a bitter, slightly acrid taste, and should be used sparingly for visual contrast and aromatic complexity. Many approaches exist, but I use a very simple one with just garlic and fat. Adding scallion or regular onion is not a bad idea, however. 

While it might appear like it at first glance, none of the vegetables used in mayu dissolve in this process; they still contain a lot of insoluble solids. Like the emulsion found in a paitan, mayu is also a colloid, which is the technical term for a mixture where one material is uniformly dispersed in another, but doesn’t dissolve in the suspending material. The difference between mayu and an emulsion is what is being dispersed. In an emulsion, a liquid is dispersed in a liquid. In mayu, a solid is dispersed in a liquid. Otherwise, several of the same concepts I mentioned earlier apply here. Much like emulsions, to make a stable mayu, you need to make the dispersed particles (in this case the cooked solids) very small so that they become indefinitely suspended in the oil. Making sure your ingredients are dry helps with this. Moisture both prolongs the frying process and results in soggier fried vegetables that are more difficult to grind. This recipe accounts for this with a two-staged approach. 

Some recipes online suggest using a food processor or blender, but I’ve found this ends up making a paste that splits over time rather than a uniform oil that’s black throughout. Combining the ingredients with a mortar and pestle has worked the best for me. If you have a suribachi (a Japanese mortar and pestle) that’s even better; the ridges are really effective at breaking down the vegetables into a fine paste. But any bowl and mashing tool (like a muddler even) will work well. 

Ingredients:
15 cloves of garlic
60 mL oil (approx. 0.25 cup). I used equal parts sesame, vegetable oil, and lard. 100% lard is nice, but it'll firm up at room temperature.

Steps:

Take the garlic cloves and throw them into a food processor. Process until finely minced (around 1/8th inch pieces). You can also mince finely by hand, though avoid turning the garlic into a paste.
Spread the mince on a paper towel and squeeze as much moisture out as possible. Replace paper towels until little to no moisture escapes. This is going to help you dry your mince out when you cook it, and that's important for suspending the particulate in the oil at the end.
Heat your oil on the stove, and when warm, add your aromatics. You can test this by throwing a small amount of your garlic into the oil and seeing if it sizzles. 
Cook, on medium to medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the garlic takes on a dark brown, almost black color, and the oil begins to smoke, around 15-20 minutes. 
Strain the solids, reserving the oil, and then lay the solids on more paper towels to remove excess oil. This is once again to keep things as dry and brittle as possible. You should be left with garlic pieces that you can crumble into dust between your fingers.
Add your solids only to a mortar and pestle, and mash until the oil within them begins to escape and the contents turn into a uniform paste. This takes around 5 minutes. 
Once the paste is smooth, with no visible grit, add the reserved oil from step 6 to thin the mayu to your liking and mix fully. 
Store in an airtight container until ready to use. If not using immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months.

CHAPTER 6: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER


Full Blown Preparation Process (David - Nice to know, but probably not applicable for casual use)
This process will break down a hypothetical scenario for a shoyu ramen to be served on a Sunday. Given the cooking time for some of the components, the weekend/days off are good times, much like a household prepares a stew on Sunday. But this general approach will work for any bowl of ramen you wind up making.

Sunday, one week out (around 1-2 hours of work)

	Cook the tare. Usually, this involves soaking some items in soy or water, then heating them. Assembly is minimal; store in the fridge after cooking. Tare, broadly, can be kept in the fridge for very long periods due to its high salt content.
	Cook the aroma oil if possible, store in the fridge until ready to use. If the fat comes from the soup, you'll need to wait, but this is helpful, as it's one less component you'll need to prepare.
	Make or purchase the noodles. For first-timers, I recommend buying the noodles over making them. But ramen noodles get better as they age in the fridge, and can stay in the fridge for up to two weeks while still being safe to eat.

Saturday, the day before (around 6-10 hours of work, mostly idle waiting for things to cook)

	Prep the soup. If you have one, use a pressure cooker to save time. 
	Cook chashu. Since chashu needs to usually be cold to be sliced, you can make it in advance. Feel free to freeze leftovers for later use.
	Cook and steep eggs: eggs need around a day or so to steep (especially with a diluted brine of 100 mL water, 20 mL soy sauce, and 10 mL mirin or so, where eggs can sit for days at a time without over-curing). You can cook these while the chashu and soup go.

Sunday, the day of (only 30 minutes or so required)

Prep your toppings: slice the scallions, cut nori, etc. 
Assemble your bowl

With this approach, basically all of the work is done before the actual serving day. Most of the days only have an hour or so of actual intense cooking. Even though some of the processes may take a long time, they are not laborious the entire way. Soups may take hours, but there’s a lot of downtime between simmering and straining. Otherwise, this plan makes the labor involved far more digestible. 
A Note on Jiro
Jiro ramen is a unique style of ramen hailing from Tokyo, popularized in the 70s. The ramen style is unique in that the components are heavily interlocked. You may have noticed throughout this book that you can, typically, swap components depending on your tastes. If you enjoy less soy sauce, swap a shio tare. If you like a richer soup, add or remove fatback. While the broad creation of the dish is fairly straightforward by comparison, as the ingredient quantities and selection is minimal, the execution of the components can be challenging at home, as they cannot be made separately. The chashu must cook in the soup, and then must soak in the tare. The fatback is cooked in the soup, and then served as a topping. Typically this means the entire dish is made in one day, although the level of hands-on production can vary if you use tools like a pressure cooker.  

The execution of this ramen, then, requires a flowchart that differs slightly from the more flexible one listed above; typically requiring the components to be made almost all in the same day: 

The day before, make the noodles.
On the day of, start the soup
While the soup cooks, combine the ingredients to make the tare, keeping it at room temperature
Add the fatback and chashu meat. Typically these ingredients are added continuously throughout service, but at home, you can do it all in one straight shot. 
After two hours, pull the fatback and chashu. Add the chashu to the tare, let the soup continue to cook while it soaks. 
Mash the fatback into chunks, you may optionally season it with tare and / or MSG
Finally, strain the soup after it has reached your emulsified liking. Boil harder for more emulsion, and less for clearer soup. 

Other components of the style may also be prepared during the assembly of the dish. Commonly, beansprouts and cabbage are included in the dish. These are usually cooked to order along with the noodles, via boiling. 
Standard Bowl Assembly

Once you have all of your components, it’s time to assemble the bowl of ramen. 

Step 0: Get a bowl
Step 0.5: Get Your Mise en Place Ready
Step 1: Preheat Your Bowl
Step 2: Cook Your Noodles
Don’t cook your noodles in the soup itself. Fresh ramen noodles release salt, alkaline salts, starch, and even sometimes food dye as they cook. This stuff doesn’t taste all that great
Step 3: Add Tare, Aroma Oil, and Soup
While the noodles cook, add tare, aroma oil, and soup, in that order to the bowl. If you’re doing something funky, such as adding spices, pepper, or fish powder, add them with the tare. Adding the soup last ensures the tare is evenly dispersed. If you’re using a thicker tare like miso, whisk things in the serving bowl.

Step 4: Strain The Noodles

When the noodles are done, strain quickly but thoroughly and add to the bowl. 

Details:
Noodles tend to get clumpy when exposed to air after cooking. 

Remove the noodles from the cooking water immediately, and strain the noodles as thoroughly as you can. The goal is to remove as much excess water as you can in 5-10 seconds. This water will dilute your soup and potentially give it a strange flavor, so thorough straining is important.

Many chefs in Japan have developed stylistic straining methods to do this effectively. They’ll use fine mesh strainers, more specifically noodle baskets, flailing them around and spraying water everywhere. Or throw their arms to the side and crash the noodles against the confines of the noodle basket. Chef Jack Nakamura, a legendary ramen chef in Japan, is particularly known for his noodle straining technique, which has been dubbed the “Heaven’s Drop” technique38.



(OPTIONAL)Step 5: Separate and Line Up The Noodles: Noodle Fold

Details below:
Once the noodles are added to the bowl, they’ll probably be bunched up into a ball. Some shops leave the noodles as is, others use a pair of chopsticks to shake the noodles briefly in the soup to distribute them evenly and prevent them from sticking. 

This is also where you can perform the so-called, “noodle fold.” Noodle folding is a common plating technique to take the noodles and essentially fold them into a bundle. Doing this effectively separates each strand so they’re easier to pick out of the bowl while eating, and provides a platform for toppings later on. It also looks cool. I use a pair of super-long kitchen tweezers to do this, lifting the noodles and folding them over themselves. But chopsticks or tongs can be used to create the fold. 

The fold is not easy, making it takes practice. And some noodles, such as thin, low hydration ones, fold better than others, like curly, short noodles. Ultimately, it is a mostly aesthetic choice with some arguable functional benefits. If you’re dead set on noodle folds, consider the following qualities of the noodle as part of the design of the bowl:

hydration: Noodles with more water are more prone to curling. Noodles at 36% hydration or lower create better folds than those above. 
kansui composition: Potassium carbonate creates rigidity in the noodle, preventing curling. An increase in the potassium carbonate amount can help create more aesthetically pleasing folds. 
length: Longer noodles are easier to fold, as they give you more runway to pull from the soup and drape into the aforementioned noodle fold shape. 
thickness: Thicker noodles are harder to fold, as they’re more prone to slipping out of the grip of the tool you use to lift them due to their increased weight per noodle. 
cut: An oblong cut (meaning where the noodles are slightly wider than they are thick) can help with creating presentable noodles, as the noodles more easily align on the tool you use to lift them.  

Step 6: Add Toppings

Add toppings. The plating is entirely up to you, but I have a few recommendations. If you’re using nori, add it last, as it gets soggy quickly. I add the meat first so it can maintain warmth. I’m also pretty particular with the position of the toppings. Using a clock as an analogy, I like placing the green onion in the middle, chashu/meat at 6 o’clock, nori at 1 or 2 o’clock, egg at 11 or 12 o’clock, and other toppings at 3 or 9 o’clock. 

Plating examples are below. Notice that in virtually all examples, the bowl has the protein at the 6 o’clock position, with toppings aligned mostly towards the center of the bowl.

Tonkotsu Gyokai Tsukemen

Please note the slightly lower volume of soup and the slightly higher relative salinity, both of which are required for tsukemen to work.

250 mL Tsukemen “Thick” Soup
30 mL Toasted Shoyu Tare
10 mL (approx. 2 tsp) gyofun
A few grinds of black pepper
200 g (or more) Thick Tsukemen Noodle

Follow the tsukemen approach to shock the noodles thoroughly before assembling the soup. 

Jiro Ramen

The interlockings of these components require close monitoring of each, but the ingredient selection is fairly simple. 

300 mL Jiro Soup
60 mL Easy Meat Shoyu Tare
Optional: Additional MSG (often shops add an extra teaspoon to the bowl) 
200 g Jiro Noodles
Blanched Cabbage/beansprout (cook maybe 30 seconds in boiling water) 
Chopped garlic (1 tsp or so)
30ml cooked fatback from the soup

The goal is to cook both the vegetables and the noodles at the same time, but separately, to ensure that the vegetables are crisp but not mushy, while still being hot during topping. Typically, a pre-noodle cook blanch, followed by a re-dunking after the noodles are finished, is the way to go.
