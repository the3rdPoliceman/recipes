                Kathleen Meisinger from Ina Garten's Outrageous <br> <br>
                <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                90g Butter   <br>
                65g 60% Chocolate   <br>
                60g 90% Chocolate   <br>
                60g Whole Eggs   <br>
                2.7g Instant Espresso Powder   <br>
                5.2g Vanilla Extract   <br>
                90g Sucrose (Sugar)   <br>
                30g AP Flour (All-Purpose Flour)   <br>
                3g Baking Powder   <br>
                1.2g Sea Salt   <br>
                70g Chocolate Chips (half 60% half 95%) <br>
                75g Walnuts     <br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                Melt the butter, 60% and 90% chocolate, then allow to cool slightly  <br>
                In a bowl, stir (not whisk) together eggs, espresso powder, vanilla, and sugar <br>
                Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture <br>
                Sift 25g flour, the baking powder, and the sea salt together. <br>
                Use the remaining 5g flour to coat the chocolate chips and walnuts (this stops them sinking) <br>
                Fold these dry ingredients into the wet mixture in 3 additions <br>
                Grease a parchment-lined 18cm round pan, and pour in the batter <br>
                Bake at 175C for 20 mins, then bang the pan to stop an air bubble forming between the brownies and the pan. Then bake around 15 minutes more, or until a toothpick comes out clean <br>
                Allow to cool before cutting <br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                Good flavor. <br>
                Texture was not fudgy enough, too cakey. Probably due to overcooking rather than too much baking powder, as recipe is well tested by others. <br>

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                For the meringue <br>
                150g egg whites  <br>
                5ml white wine vinegar  <br>
                10ml Vanilla Extract <br>
                300g caster sugar  <br>
                25g cornflour  <br>
                For the filling <br>
                1kg berries – about 6 punnets  <br>
                15ml lemon  <br>
                350ml double cream  <br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                Whisk the egg whites, vinegar and vanilla in a spotlessly clean bowl until soft peaks form <br>
                Add in the caster sugar gradually, while whisking and continue until stiff peak stage <br>
                Add in the cornflour and whisk again briefly on a high speed until incorporated <br>
                Line a large baking tray with parchment and 2 mounds of egg white, one a bit bigger than the other <br>
                Flatten the mounds into discs and bake at 90C. The idea is that you'll see the first signs of gold appear after about 3 hours and then that stage is complete <br>
                If it starts browning too early (within 90 mins), reduce the heat and continue <br>
                Turn the oven off and wait for it to cool – the result will be crisp without and fluffy within <br>
                Once cool, stack the meringues with cream and berries on top of each layer <br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                Good <br>
                My meringues were still very soft inside. Not sure if this is standard or not? <br>

                <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                120g duck fat <br>
                2/3 onion <br>
                300g chicken livers <br>
                4.5g salt <br>
                0.5tsp pepper <br>
                2 large hard-boiled eggs <br>
                1.5 teaspoons red wine vinegar <br>
                1 teaspoon whiskey, port, or sherry wine <br>
                pinch cayenne powder <br>
                melted butter for topping (optional) <br>
                <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                Cook the onions in a third of the fat, until they are browned and beginning to caramelize, and let them drain <br>
                Add the chicken livers to the pan and season with the salt and pepper <br>
                Cook the livers, stirring often, until they are just-cooked through but still pink inside. Remove from heat <br>
                In a food processor, pulse the eggs a few times, then the remaining ingredients and puree until smooth <br>
                Taste, and adjust with salt and pepper <br>
                Press the mixture through a wide mesh sieve if you feel like it, to get it smoother <br>
                Transfer to your contained, and optionally, pour melted butter over the top to stop it discoloring <br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                Flavour was good <br>
                Texture was a bit soft. Would substitute some of the duck fat for butter. Maybe half half <br>

                    3 Cloves of garlic <br>
                    14g Salt <br>
                    40g (started at 202g Water including cup) <br>
                    1tsp Dried coriander <br>
                    1tsp Cumin <br>
                    <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                    Soak chickpeas overnight in 2l water with 21g salt and 7g baking soda. <br>
                    Roughly chop veg and add to food processor, followed by crushed garlic, chickpeas and water. Process until forms smoothish pesto consistency. <br>
                    Process in the salt. <br>
                    (Tastes too salty at this point) <br>
                    Beat with the whisk attachment (looks like 2 combs) of the food processor until pale, light and foamy.  <br>
                    Add the spices and beat again until incorporated. <br>
                    Leave to rest for 2 hours. <br>
                    <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                    After adding the spices and beating again, the mixture seemed to deflate somewhat. Not sure if that was really to do with the spices or a coincidence <br>
                    TOO MUCH SALT. Here i used salt when soaking and salt in the mix. In total it was quite a bit too much. <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        4 Chicken thighs <br>
                        Spring onion (originally Japanese leak, spring onion seems to be closest) <br>
                        Ginger skin, from a thumb sized piece <br>
                        50ml Water <br>
                        1 tsp Sugar <br>
                        1/2 tsp Salt <br>

                        1 tsp Sake <br>
                        1 tsp Sesame oil <br>
                        1 large egg <br>
                        2 tbsp all-purpose flour <br>
                        2 tbsp potato starch <br>

                        Frying oil, as needed <br>          <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Followed the recipe as closely as possible <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Would remove the skin from the thighs <br>
                        Not convinced that thigh meat is better than breast meat for this, but it's worth another try with skinless thigh meat. <br>
                        Lost their crunch a bit quickly. Maybe didn't cook enough in the first fry<br>
                        Less flavour than the previous version from 24.04<br>

                        1 large onion <br>
                        3 red pepper <br>
                        5 cloves garlic <br>
                        5 bay leaves <br>
                        20ml olive oil <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        cover chicken with spices
                        Roughly chop the onion and pepper and mix with chilli, garlic, bay, oil, and some salt.
                        Set baking paper on foil, add the veggies, then then chicken on top and a it more oil to moisten the spices on the chicken <br>
                        Wrap up and let sit an hour or more<br>
                        roast at 190C fan for 80 minutes <br>
                        Open it up and give it 25 minutes uncovered <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Maybe not spicy enough this time, without the full chilli, and the extre paprika. <br>
                        Needed a bit longer uncovered this time, i guess with the extra onions and peppers <br>
                        Pretty good though<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        For the sauce
                        60g dark brown sugar
                        40g gochujang (Korean chilli paste)
                        30g soy sauce
                        10g garlic cloves, crushed
                        25g ginger, grated
                        10g sesame oil

                        For the chicken
                        300g chicken breast sliced
                        20g ginger, finely grated
                        35g cornflour

                        0.7g ground glack pepper
                        Canola oil, for frying

                        For the sauce, blitz everything in a food processor, then let bubble gently for a few minutes in a saucepan
                        For the chicken, mix with the ginger, then add the cornflour, salt and pepper
                        Deep fry at 190C in the oil, then fry quickly in the sauce
                        Serve with rice, and sprinkle the spring onion and sesame seeds over
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Great!
                        The sauce might have been a bit too thick, although i think it's supposed to be a sticky coating more than a sauce like sweet and sour. Maybe a little pineapple juice to loosen it could work if you want a runnier sauce.

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        140g butter <br>
                        140g dark chocolate  <br>
                        5 eggs, separated <br>
                        140g sugar <br>
                        1g salt <br>
                        2g vinegar <br>
                        200g chestnuts (cooked. or chestnuts and chestnut flour - see original recipe. Chestnut flour is expensive (10chf/300g) but cheaper than chestnuts (4chf/100g). It's popular in poland (called Mąka kasztanowa) so maybe googling can find a much supplier cheaper (price in poland - 10eur/kg) <br>
                        200ml cream <br>
                        20g Chocolate (for garnish) <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Heat oven to 180C no fan <br>
                        Melt butter in a saucepan, take off the heat and melt the chocolate into it. Stir together <br>
                        Whisk the egg yolks, 80g sugar, and salt until pale and thick. Stir into the warm chocolate <br>
                        Whisk egg whites until fluffy. Add remaining sugar and beat until stiff peaks <br>
                        Process half the chestnuts into fine powder, and half into pea sized pieces and add to the chocolate batter. Gradually fold in the egg whites, and scrape into a lined 23cm pan <br>
                        Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, cool on a rack <br>
                        Decorate with whipped cream, and shave chocolate over <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Great <br>
                        Chestnuts were slightly crunchy - maybe they could have been soaked in something - vanilla rum etc <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        From the recipe, but used breast meat <br>
                        Served sprinkled with spring onions, toasted white sesame seeds, mayo, lemon juice and sea salt flakes <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Did pretty much as told <br>
                        Needed to be quite rough with shaking off the potato starch so it didn't clump too much <br>
                        Fried in olive oil, which was probably a mistake <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Great flavour, but next time find an oil that will leave a light finish. Probably Canola (Rapsöl)<br>

                        75g flour <br>
                        100g eggs  <br>

                        FILLING <br>
                        225g quark (substituting the quark as i don't know what farmers cheese is), chilled <br>
                        120g cream cheese, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces, chilled <br>

                        <br>
                        SAUCE <br>
                        120g dried apricots (i used unsweetened), coarsely chopped <br>
                        20g honey  <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                         Following recipe <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Filling was too liquid. Maybe try ricotta or cottage cheese instead of quark. Also, cheese clothing the cream cheese wouldn't hurt, but is a pain in the ass. <br>
                        In the United States, farmer cheese is simply pressed curds <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        200g cream cheese <br>
                        200g double cream <br>
                        4.4g cornflour <br>
                        1g salt (optional) <br>
                        80g caster sugar <br>
                        70g eggs, beaten <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Beat the cream cheese, then beat in the cream, cornflour, salt, sugar and eggs unitl smooth <br>
                        Divided into 3 plastic bags, and sous vide one bag at 75C, 80C and 85C respectively, until the chesecake mix reached 73C, 79C and 82C <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        73C - Creamy, and quite light. Almost no leakage after 12 hours <br>
                        79C - in between <br>
                        84C - Fudgy, felt more dense, and leaked more water <br>

                        In all cases, there was a somewhat grainy appearance (despite the 73C feeling smooth). This was probably due to the cornstarch not being well enough incorporated. Maybe should dissolve it in a small amount of cream first to form a well mixed slurry and/or use an immersion blender <br>

                        <strong>Details:</strong> <br>
                        GOAL: Higher hydration in dough, to see effect <br>

                        Mix honey, water and yeast and leave 5 minutes <br>
                        Mix salt into flour <br>
                        Add water to the yeast mix, then stir into the flour <br>
                        Kneaded by slap and fold for about 7-10 minutes, then mixed in oil <br>
                        Let rise until doubled at room temp <br>
                        Oil the pan, dump in the dough and finger it out, like <a href="https://youtu.be/LbmaHF13SRE?t=580">https://youtu.be/LbmaHF13SRE?t=580</a>

                        GOALS: Swap out milk for water <br>
                        TOTAL FLOUR: 400g <br>
                        TOTAL WATER: 250 in dough. 340 incl. brine <br>
                        RATIO: 62.5% in dough. 85% incl. brine <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br> 
                        Mix honey, water and yeast and leave 5 minutes <br>
                        Mix salt into flour <br>
                        Add water to the yeast mix, then stir into the flour <br>
                        Knead until smoothish (lumpy windowpane could just about be teased out of it), and mix in oil <br>
                        Let rise at room temp (600ml to 1300ml)<br>
                        Oil the pan, dump in the dough and finger it out flat rather than rolling (no cleaning pin or rolling surface. less hand cleaning, like <a href="https://youtu.be/LbmaHF13SRE?t=580">https://youtu.be/LbmaHF13SRE?t=580</a> <br>
                        Leave to rise again (see <a href="https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347">https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347</a> for goal texture) <br>
                        Mix the oil and water for the brine into an emulsion  <br>
                        Finger the dough into the corners, cover with brine, sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 250C until golden <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br> 
                        Dough was noticeably wetter and stretchier than previous attempts <br>
                        Quantity seemed better for round pan <br>
                        Similar crumb to previous efforts, as in a bit too fine <br>
                        400g seems good for this tray - maybe a little more like 450 would also be good. Or somehow get it to rise a bit more, so be thicker but airier <br>
                        Salt was good for eating plain. If using for sandwiches, adjust saltiness to ingredients e.g. Ham and provalone might not need any salt on the foccacia <br>

                        21g yeast <br>
                        60g milk + 40g water (temp 27C) <br>

                        40g oil <br>
                        TOP: <br>
                        2.5g Sea salt <br>
                        <strong>Details:</strong> <br>
                        GOALS: Increase salt levels to improve flavor, try not to let air bubble under pan <br>
                        TOTAL FLOUR: 500g <br>
                        TOTAL WATER & MILK: 310 in dough. 420 incl. brine <br>
                        RATIO: 62% in dough. 84% incl. brine <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br> 
                        Mix honey, milk + water and yeast and leave 5 minutes <br>
                        Mix salt into flour <br>
                        Add water to the yeast mix, then stir into the flour <br>
                        Knead until smooth, and mix in oil <br>
                        Let rise until doubled at room temp <br>
                        Oil the 32cm round pan, then roll out the dough and place in the pan, and leave to rise again (see <a href="https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347">https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347</a> for goal texture) <br>
                        Mix the oil and water for the brine into an emulsion  <br>
                        Finger the dough into the corners, cover with brine, sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 250C until golden <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br> 
                        Dough wasn't tougher with salt. If anything the opposite <br>
                        Left the yeast fermenting longer - dough seemed more workable I guess as a result of this<br>
                        Crumb was slightly more open - possible due to less kneading as the dough was softer <br>
                        Better flavor - increased salt is good and had no downside <br>
                        Had a swampy patch - need to be careful to finger it out evenly <br>
                        No air bubble this time, which I think confirms it was trapped air last time <br>
                        20% less dough for this pan might be better <br>
                        <strong>Knowledge:</strong> <br> 
                        2% salt to flour weight is much better <br>
                        Try to get it into the pan as evenly as possible with as little messing with it as possible <br>
                        Heat oven with fan, then top bottom <br>

                        TOP: <br>
                        2.5g Sea salt <br>
                        <strong>Details:</strong> <br>
                        GOAL: Test if oil inhibiting gluten network development during kneading <br>
                        TOTAL FLOUR: 500g <br>
                        TOTAL WATER & MILK: 310 in dough. 420 incl. brine <br>
                        RATIO: 62% in dough. 84% incl. brine <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br> 
                        Mix honey, milk + water and yeast and leave 5 minutes <br>
                        Mix salt into flour <br>
                        Add water to the yeast mix, then stir into the flour <br>
                        Knead until smooth(bored) - around 20 minutes. Got a vague windowpane (see photos), then mixed in oil <br>
                        Let rise until doubled at room temp (Did this in oiled jug and it doubled in around 45 minutes) <br>
                        Oil the pan, then roll out the dough and place in the pan, and leave to rise again (see <a href="https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347">https://youtu.be/TIOcTgyuTIo?t=347</a> for goal texture) <br>
                        Mix the oil and water for the brine into an emulsion  <br>
                        Finger the dough into the corners, cover with brine, sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 250C until golden <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br> 
                        Was a bit too much dough for the 32cm round dish (750cm2). <br>
                        Giant bubble formed under the entire dough and it puffed way up, into an upside down bowl shape. Has to be taken out and flipped - I guess air was trapped when i placed the dough in the tray<br>
                        Reduced oiliness would leave it edible in larger amounts <br>
                        Softer and airier than previous efforts, with a more breadlike structure. Bubbles were slightly too small though - would prefer a more rustic open crumb<br>
                        Hard to tell about oil and brine levels - maybe a lot ended up on the oven floor due to the giant bubble <br>  
                        <strong>Knowledge:</strong> <br> 
                        Proofing correctly led to better bake <br>
                        If rolling out, need to be careful about trapping air underneath when placing in the pan. Like these guys say <a href="https://youtu.be/zhjufashMj4?t=325">https://youtu.be/zhjufashMj4?t=325</a> <br>

                        Kneading didn't show any signs of window pane test. Try more water next time <br>
                        Reduced oil was better <br>
                        Didn't rise - either left it too long, or gluten was poor <br>

                        Roll out and place in oiled pan (35g oil) <br>
                        leave to rise again  <br>
                        Mix and emulsify the brine ingredients (shaking in a bottle is good) <br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Didn't seem to have risen enough. Probably overproofed<br>
                        Crumb had small pockets <br>
                        Probably needed more brine - possibly just more water <br>
                        I might have been slightly too aggressive with the holes - I pushed until i felt the bottom of the pan firmly <br>
                        I cooked it much hotter than fausto suggested - 270C rather than 200C. Maybe thats why the top browned so quickly while the holes were very raw - they should be soft and a bit creamy, but part of it was slightly too raw <br>
                        Too oily to eat much. Could be uses for an appetizer, but eating too much gave indigestion <br>
                        <strong>Knowledge:</strong> <br> 
                        Too much oil leaves the foccacia difficult to digest <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        1000g potatoes (waxy, raclette) <br>
                        9g salt <br>
                        70g butter infused with a small bunch of thyme (yields about 45ml of butter as quite a bit sticks to the thyme)<br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Process the potatoes. 700g in large food processor, 300g in small <br>
                        Rinse the potatoes briefly in water by filling bowl with water then draining <br>
                        Drain and squeeze out as hard as possible in a tea towel. Mix in the salt. <br>
                        Add 25ml of the melted butter to the pan at 4/6 heat, then add the potatoes and squeeze down <br>
                        Fry the rösti on a relatively low heat until browned underneat<br>
                        Drizzle and brush with 20ml of the thyme butter, then flip and fry again until the second side is also brown. <br>
                        The potatoes are find of frying/steaming/baking all at the same time <br>
                        Served plain, and with Creme fraiche and chives <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Texture was similar to last time - still a bit fall aparty <br>
                        Thyme was a good addition <br>
                        Probably needed a little more butter on the second side. It dissappeared into the potato a bit <br>
                        Was good with creme fraiche and chives <br>
                        <strong>Changes next time:</strong> <br>

                        9g salt <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Grate or Process the potatoes. Large side of the grater, or large food processor grater. The food processor gives potatoes a bit more like julienne texture, which is probably not quite as good, but it is fast. <br>
                        Rinse the potatoes briefly in water then drain and squeeze out in a tea towel. Mix in the salt. <br>
                        Fry the rösti on a relatively low heat until browning underneath. Transfer to a 170C oven and bake for 15-20 minutes. <br>
                        Flip and fry again until the second side is also brown. <br>
                        The potatoes are find of frying/steaming/baking all at the same time <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Very decent.  <br>
                        The texture was less like a solid cake, and wanted to fall apart a bit too much. I think from the food processor, but maybe washing the starch out wasn't really needed. <br>
                        Next time would try it just in the pan. Maybe covered. <br>

                        700ml Water <br>
                        350g fish <br>
                        1 lemon <br>
                        little flour for dusting <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Chill all the batter ingredients for an hour in the freezer. <br>
                        Whisk the salt into the water until dissolved, then add the chopped up lemon and the fish. Brine for 10 minutes, then take out. <br>
                        Heat oil to 190C <br>
                        Make the batter by whisking everything except the beer together so they're evenly distributed. Add the beer, and combine with as little movement as possible. <br>
                        Flour the fish lightly, then dip in the batter and straight into the oil <br>
                        While it fries, you can add extra batter. I do this by using a spider to lift the fish quickly above the oil and drizzling more batter over with a spoon <br>
                        Drain on a rack <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Super bubbly batter from the baking powder and beer, that gave a very crispy result.  <br>

                    <div class="log-detail">
                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        500g cream cheese, room temp <br>
                        200g creme fraiche, room temp <br>
                        210g caster sugar <br>
                        2.5g salt (optional) <br>
                        3.5 eggs, beaten <br>
                        11g cornflour <br>
                        50ml double cream <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Beat the cheese with a wooden spoon until soft, the beat in, in order, creme fraiche, sugar & salt, eggs (one at a time) <br>
                        Dissolve the cornflour in some of the double cream - it's easier to start with a little and form a paste, and then gradually add the cream. Beat this cream and cornflour into the cream cheese mix <br>
                        You're aiming to get no air bubbles, so the final cheesecake has a dense texture. <br>
                        (It should also be possible to mix with an immersion blender instead of a wooden spoon, as long as it's fully submerged so it doesn't add air) <br>
                        Line an 18cm pan with baking paper - one piece for the base and one for the sides. The piece used for the side should extend well above the sides of the pan as the mixture may double in size during cooking <br>
                        Cooked at 220C fan <br>
                        Taken out with lowest temperature (in the middle of the middle) at 50C. Not sure how long it took <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Generally the result was very good. <br>
                        Opening the oven to check the temp didn't seem to have and bad side effect. It sunk a bit, but then rose again. It sinks anyway while cooling. <br>
                        Took it out when it was mostly chestnut brown and getting to the point of burnt in a few places. Some people burn it more but it doesn't seem to taste better in the burnt places. I'd stick to deep chestnut brown. <br>
                        <strong>Next Time:</strong> <br>
                        Would take it out slightly earlier - maybe at 45C. The middle was still a bit creamy, but not as much as some i've seen. In this case the oven temperature would need to be a little higher to get it browned when the middle is 45C <br>
                        Would try buttering the interior surface of the bottom baking paper to see if that allows it to be removed after cooling <br>
                        Would try a little more flour next time, as it had a hint of weeping at the base after cooling.  <br>
                        Other possible things to tweak would include using 250ml double cream instead of 50ml double cream and 200g creme fraiche (the original uses only double) <br>
                        Would also he interesting to hang the cheese in cheesecloth to remove some of the moisture <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        5 sheets of gelatine (This is only needed if it should be reasonably cuttable. For eclairs for example it wouldn't be necessary) <br>
                        120g egg yolks <br>
                        200g caster sugar <br>
                        75g cornflour <br>
                        4 vanilla pods <br>
                        750ml whole milk <br>
                        600ml very cold full cream <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Creme Pat: <br>
                        Add the vanilla seeds and pods to the milk, bring to the boil, and leave to steep 30 minutes. <br>
                        Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water. <br>
                        Whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar, then whisk in the cornflour. <br>
                        Reheat the milk, remove the vanilla pods, and pour over the egg mixture while whisking. <br>
                        Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and heat on medium until it boils, stirring constantly. <br>
                        Pour the custard into a clean dish, add the softened gelatine, and whisk until thoroghly incorporated. <br>
                        Cover with cling film, and refrigerate until completely chilled. <br>
                        Prepare the Creme Diplomat: <br>
                        Whip the very cold full cream to soft peaks <br>
                        Beat the creme pat to soften, then fold in the whipped cream  <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        By recipe with exceptions: <br>
                        half teaspoon vanilla powder, soaked in 20ml vanilla rum instead of vanilla pods
                        granulated sugar instead of fine <br>
                        Coop bio fleur de sel chocolate <br>
                        50ml amaretto in cake + 20 ml soak <br>
                        60g chocolate. 15g butter for icing <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Cooked about 70 minutes at 160C fan <br>
                         
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Salted chocolate was distracting <br>
                        Should have been baked slightly cooler and longer, as edges were dark, but middle should have been cooked a bit more <br>
                        Smaller quantity to give shallower cake might have been better. Would reduce at least 20% <br>
                        Mine domed a lot, whereas the one in the video remained nearly flat <br>
                        Probably should add a bit of salt to the batter <br>
                        Stayed very moist the next day even without covering <br>

                        As recipe, but added zest of an orange into the filling
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                         Followed more or less exactly
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Probably a bit overbaked. Dough was slightly dry - came out a more homogenous dry spongey texture rather than soft flakes that pull apart - maybe more fat?

                        Katsu: Beat your meat until around 1cm thick, the salt, flour, egg, and breadcrumb it. Deep fry at 180C until golden (check internal temp too) <br>

                        Maybe a bit too much juice running from mine, so probably better to drain th slaw juice a bit (OTOH,  if nobobdy's watching, who cares) <br>

                        brown sugar <br>

                        Heat the milk with the salt and vanilla and leave to infuse (milk takes flavor better than cream) <br>
                        Beat the egg yolks, white sugar and cream together <br>

                        Blowtorch it to form a crust, few black spots is ok <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        The cream wasn't quite as smooth as i would have liked. Next time try not actually making a custard <br>
                        The crust was a little thicker than i'd have liked. Maybe finer sugar would do it <br>
                        To get the ratio of cream to crust right, you want about 2cm of ream and a thin crust <br>

                        Spread on a papered baking sheet <br>
                        Cover a sheet pan with the dough, and let it sit for a half hour. <br>
 <br>
                        Heat the oven to 180 C and bake until the meringues start to crack, about 15 minutes.  <br>
                        Cool completely before filling. <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        First impression - seems too sweet, from tasting dough <br>
                        Very lumpy. Should use finer ground nuts<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        50g dried unsweetened apricots
                        35ml vanilla rum
                        96g unsalted butter, softened
                        75g jacutinga sugar
                        60g white sugar
                        2 egg yolks
                        1 egg white
                        10g icing sugar
                        130g ground almonds
                        1.25 tsp baking powder
                        0.33 teaspoon salt
                        70g 87% chocolate, frozen, then blitzed until sandy texture
                        30g cocoa powder
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Chop and blitz the apricots, and soak in the rum overnight. After they've soaked squeeze out the excess rum <br>
                        Cream the butter and sugars, then gradually beat in the egg yolks <br>
                        Combine the almonds, baking powder, salt and chocolate and mix well. Mix in the apricots, then stir into the batter<br>
                        Beat the egg whites until stiff, adding the icing sugar towards the end. Fold into the previous mixture, keeping as much air as possible <br>
                        Baked for 55 minutes at 150C fan <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Better than the last attempt, but still a bit sour <br>
                        More chocoaltey than last attempt which was good, and not so wet. Attribute this to the increased almonds and reduced butter, and maybe the baking powder helped too<br>
                        Probably a bit too cocoa-ey. Maybe more chocolate could be added instead of the cocoa (my worry was that chocolate was making it wetter, but that seems to be less of an issue here) <br>
                        Next time, would try with sweetened apricots rather than the sour ones, 20g cocoa, and 90g chocolate<br>

                        A bit too moist (kind of greasy), and not enough chocolate taste<br>
                        Reduce the butter 30g and see what happens <br>
                        Add a bit more chocolate. Either chocolate, or cocoa if that makes it too wet <br>
                        Good apricot flavor, but a bit sour.<br>

                        Put on a baking sheet with baking paper, brush the top with the remaining liqued, and bake at 180C for about 20 minutes, until well browned <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Really good - a bit sweeter, richer and more cakey than a british scone <br>
                        Also added a little lemon zest, orange would be good too, as would dried fruits or nuts <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        700g aubergines <br>
                        20g salt <br>
                        2l water <br>
                        700ml olive oil <br>
                        150g mozzarella, drained, sliced, and squeezed out a bit  <br>
                        120g Scamorza, thinly sliced <br>
                        60g parmesan <br>
                        350g tomato ragu <br>
                        15g basil leaves <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Slice the aubergines in about 6mm slices <br>
                        Dissolve the salt in the water, then soak the aubergines for about an hour <br>
                        Drain the aubergines and squeeze the water out of the well <br>
                        Heat the oil to 180C, and fry the aubergine slices in small batches (about 4 slices at a time) so the oil doesn't cool <br>
                        Spread a layer of tomato ragu on the dish as the first layer <br>
                        Now add a layer of aubergines. Calculate how many layers you're gonna do based on how many slices you used for the first, and roughly divide up the mozzarella, scamorza, parmesan basil, and tomato ragu. You'll need a bit extra ragu and cheese for the top layer <br>
                        Scatter mozzarella, scamorza, basil leaves, parmesan and a few blobs of tomato ragu on the aubergines, add another layer of aubergines <br>
                        Repeat the layering until all the aubergines are used up <br>
                        Top with a thin layer of ragu to protect the aubergines from the oven, and scatter with remaining cheese <br>
                        Bake for 10 mins at 180C fan, and then at 130C until done <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Not bad <br>
                        Probably better with a more basic tomato ragu, as the texture of the meaty bits was a bit annoying. And in general, the meatiness was a bit much. <br>
                        Scamorza (especially on top) was a bit chewier than I would have wanted - I'd reduce it to 70g, roughly grate it, and not have any on the top <br>
                        10g basil would be enough <br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Nothing special, but fine  <br>
                        Designed to be used in place of neapolitan ragu - Probably too many bits in it for some recipes, as it should be more like a smooth tomato ragu with meat flavor. But it's good enough if the texture isn't super important <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        500g frozen raspberries
                        3 egg whites
                        90g sugar
                        4 egg yolks
                        1tsp vanilla extract
                        375g mascarpone
                        20g Simple Syrup (50:50 water sugar by weight)
                        12 ladyfinger biscuits
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Leave the raspberries to thaw completely in a sieve over a bowl. Overnight
                        Have the eggs and mascarpone in the fridge overnight, and take out 20 minutes before starting to make the tiramisu
                        In a bowl, whisk the egg whites until almost stiff. Add 20g sugar, and continue whisking until stiff
                        In a second bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar intil thick and pale. Whisk in the vanilla
                        In a third bowl, whip the mascarpone a little, on the slowest speed to soften it up, so it will combine more easily with the other ingredients
                        Add the egg yolk mix into the mascarpone, and whisk at the slowest setting until smoothly combined
                        Fold in the egg whites
                        Mix the juice from the raspberries with the simple syrup. Do this to taste and don't make it too sweet
                        Dunk the ladyfingers in the juice until they soak a decent amount of it. It took about 10 seconds each side, as they wouldnt fully submerge.
                        Layer up mascarpone mix, then biscuits, then half the raspberries. Repeat, top with the rest of the mascarpone mix
                        Sprinkle with lime leaf powder (freeze dried raspberries would also work)
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Really good <br>
                        Could have some extra accent flavor - lime or orange maybe, or ispahan

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        3 medium Potatoes - Jelly variety<br>
                        1/2 tsp baking powder<br>

                        50ml Olive Oil <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Day 1 <br>
                        Peel the potatoes and rinsed 5 minutes in cold water to remove starch (wasn't obvious that much was coming out - might depend on variety). Add them to the cold water along with the baking soda and salt<br>
                        Cook until soft in the middle, drain, rough up a bit, set on a rack and leave to dry overnight outside in the cold<br>
                        Day 2 <br>
                        Heat the oven, with a tray inside to 240C <br>
                        Heat the oil in a frying pan until it starts to smoke, then fry the potatoes in there for a bit until starting to brown<br>
                        Put in the oven, and roast until well browned <br>

                        Good. 7/10<br>
                        Maybe could be boiled a bit less, so they could be roughed up more, and then given more time in the oven <br>
                        Maybe the frying pan bit is unnecessary - Sorted chef just coat the in oil and fat cold and whacks them in the oven (240 to start them turned down)<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        lemon stock - 1.5l water, shells of 3 lemons (after juicing), 6 lime leaves. Water heated to i guess 70C, then left overnight to steep. Reduced to 750ml <br>
                        200g spaghetti <br>
                        10g oil <br>
                        25g butter <br>
                        30g parmesan, finely grated <br>
                        drizzle of lemon oil - (made from zest of 1 lemon, blitzed to death with 40ml rapeseed oil, then passed through a fine sieve) <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Cook the spaghetti in a frying pan with the lemon stock and some salt.  <br>
                        Be gentle with it until the spaghetti absorbs enough water to be flexible. <br>
                        Basically, cook it like a risotto, adding more water if you need, until the spaghetti is cooked, and a small amount of starchy liquid is left <br>
                        Like finishing a risotto - Remove from the heat, then stir in the cheese and butter (oil is another option) to get a creamy consistency <br>
                        Thin the sauce with some water or more lemon stock if needed <br>
                        Serve with black pepper and with a little of the lemon oil <br>

                        Horribly bitter from the lemon piths. Either piths from sorrento lemons taste a lot better, or its a mistake to use anything more than the zest <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        1L chicken stock <br>
                        16 sheets gelatines<br>
                        800g can peeled whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano <br>
                        60ml extra-virgin olive oil <br>
                        1300g mixed beef & pork mince <br>
                        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>
                        60g unsalted butter <br>
                        100g finely diced bacon <br>
                        1 large onion, finely minced <br>
                        2 carrots, finely chopped  <br>
                        4 ribs celery, finely chopped  <br>
                        4 medium cloves garlic, minced <br>
                        20g fresh sage leaves, shredded <br>
                        25g fresh parsley leaves, chopped <br>
                        500ml dry white or red wine <br>
                        250ml whole milk <br>
                        2 bay leaves <br>
                        250ml heavy cream <br>
                        85g finely grated Parmesan cheese <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Made according to the recipe. Substituting bacon for pancetta, and leaving out livers and fish sauce<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Good<br>
                        Leaving out the fish sauce was good (perhaps a little would be ok) <br>
                        Using the pork shoulder, chicken livers, siedfleisch and pancetta was better for meaty flavour.
                        The pork/beef/pancetta mix was definitely better than just beef. The coarse grind from the person at the meat counter was definitely good too <br>
                        Dish was too small for the oven<br>
                        Nutmeg seems to be a common addition <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                        200g almonds <br>
                        200g bread, crust removed <br>
                        750ml water  <br>

                        6.0g salt <br>
                        Small clove garlic, middle removed <br>
                        60ml oil <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Included some ice, as part of the water to keep the temp down <br> <br>
                        Blitzed the ice, water, almonds, bread <br>
                        Gradually added the salt and vinegar until I got to the amounts in the recipe above  <br>
                        Added in the oil and blended more <br>
                        Crushed the garlic and added it in at the end (as i forgot it earlier) <br>
                        Fridge to chill <br>
                        Served with grapes, olive oil, and a few cedar/pine nuts <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Bit too garlicy initially, but that might mellow <br>
                        Some people suggest blitzing the nuts with some of the oil at the start - this might help break them down more smoother. Soaking them overnight is also suggested (but change the water after soaking according to the gipsy chef) <br>
                        Tested with double the oil - this tastes good, but becomes very rich. If eating a reasonable quantity, the recipe above is good <br>
                        Yield: 1100ml <br>

                        Try serving with a little mint next time <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        133.33g split fava beans <br>
                        33.33g spring onions <br>

                        20g parsley <br>
                        1.33 cloves of garlic <br>
                        0.67 tsp dried coriander <br>
                        0.5 tsp cumin <br>
                        0.33 tsp black pepper <br>
                        0.17 tsp cayenne <br>
                        6.67g salt <br>
                        200ml water <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Used ingredients according to my existing recipe (2/3 quantity), but added 200ml water during the blending so it all blended easily and smoothly <br>
                        After blending, i let the mix sit in a sieve until 130ml water had drained off, meaning 70ml was still in the mix. I had the impression I could easily have removed more water by squeezing lightly in cheesecloth <br>
                        The mix tasted good at this point <br>  
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Great. Was worried the water might make them sloppy or stodgy, but not at all <br>

                        105g sugar <br>
                        22g basil (weight of leaves and stems) <br>
                        1 tbsp cornflour <br>
                        2 eggs <br>
                        juice of 1 lemon <br>
                        zest of 1 lemon <br>
                        250g full cream <br>
                        15ml limoncello <br>
                        1.5g salt <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        mortar and pestle the basil and half the sugar <br>
                        Put cornflour, eggs, lemon juice and zest in a saucepan <br>
                        Heat over medium until it thickens and starts bubbling. Let it bubble for another 30 seconds <br>
                        Strain it into the cream and limoncello, then mix, add in the basil sugar <br>
                        Taste for salt, then chill and churn <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Pretty happy <br>
                        Probably doable with a bit less cornflour <br>
                        Probably should have the lemon zest in large pieces, and them remove before churning <br>
                        Need to make sure the basil is completely pestled. Maybe should even sieve it out <br>

                        Melt the butter and mix in the porridge oats, followed by the flour, baking powder and salt <br>

                        Line a baking sheet with parchment, and spoon out the mix. You should have 6 biscuits per baking sheet, and they spread a lot <br>
                        Bake at 170C until there is a midium brown ring around the edge of each biscuit. About 6-8 minutes <br>
                        Take out, slide sheet off pan, and allow to cool

                        Best cooked reasonably near the bottom, to ensure the bottom of the cookie crisps up and releases from the paper before the top gets overdone <br>

                        150 g soft butter, στο pieces
                        125 g granulated sugar
                        2.5 eggs, room temperature
                        40 g white flour
                        1 teaspoon Baking powder
                        60 g ground pistachios
                        Zest of 2 lemons
                        100 g ground almonds
                        syrup
                        Juice of 2 lemons
                        50 g granulated sugar
                        60 g pistachios, roughly chopped
                        <strong>Method:</strong>
                        Mix the flour, baking powder, pistachio powder, lemon zest and almond flour in a bowl
                        Beat the butter and sugar until pale and light - about 10 minutes
                        Beat the eggs in a small bowl, and gradually beat into the butte mix
                        Combine all the dry ingredients, then combine with the butter mix, stirring as little as possible (did this by whisking in on slowest speed for about 10 seconds)
                        Put the dough in a lined 18cm pan and bake until it starts coming away from the sides and a stick comes out clean. About 35 minutes
                        Meanwhile, heat the lemon juice and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the chopped pistachios, bring to a boil and take off the heat.
                        Remove the cake from the tin, and take the baking paper off the bottom but leave it on the sides. Pour the hot pistachio syrup over the top and let everything cool down completely, then remove the baking paper from the sides
                        Slice the cake and serve with Greek yogurt
                        <strong>Result:</strong>
                        Really good. Not sure wht i would do to improve it <br>

                    <div class="log-detail">
                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        175g butter preferably clear <br>
                        70g unpeeled almonds <br>
                        0.40 tsp baking powder <br>
                        1/4 tsp vanilla powder <br>
                        60g powdered sugar & extra for sprinkling <br>
                        25g vanilla rum <br>
                        350g flour <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong> <br>
                        Roast the almonds at 160C for about 13 minutes (longer than suggested). Leave them to cool well and bash them in a mortar and pestle. Left reasonably big pieces, up to half a nut  <br>
                        Beat the butter at high speed for 10 minutes, until white and fluffy. More beating more better <br>
                        Add the sugar and beat again for 10 minutes <br>
                        Mix the flour and baking powder, and add gradually while beating slowly <br>
                        Finally add the almonds and rum and mix in <br>
                        Divide the dough into 16 balls and squish the top a bit. Bake on greaseproof paperat 170C for 20-30 minutes, until just colored<br>
                        Remove from the oven, cool thoroughly and roll them in a bowl of icing sugar to cover well. It's important they cool befoer the sugar goes on <br>
                        Sprinkle extra icing sugar when serving them <br>
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> <br>
                        They shouldn't brown much <br>
                        Initially, more beating more better <br>
                        Clarified butter may be better <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> <br>
                        Not bad, but not revolutionary either <br>
                        Some more nuts would improve it - maybe 100g, and more alcohol or vanilla. Maybe a little orange zest would be goods <br>
                        Maybe the goats butter would have a stronger flavor <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        50g Basil leaves <br>
                        80ml of gran fruttato <br>
                        20g parmesan <br>
                        15g cedar nuts <br>
                        1 clove garlic <br>
                        salt to taste - maybe 1g? <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br> 
                        pound and grind the nuts and garlic, until pulverised <br>
                        Rinse the basil, add to the mortar with a little salt, and grind again <br>
                        add cheese and oil, grind a third time <br>
                        test for salt <br>
                         <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br> 
                        Garlic was too strong. probably because it was reasonably old. Next time try with less garlic, or younger <br>
                        Might go quicker if the basil is chopped a bit before adding <br>

                        Not great - a bit stodgy. <br>
                        The pastry was hard to work with. Tasted fine, but was falling apart so much that it was impossible to pick up, and hard to get even in the tin <br>

                        Line a baking sheet with parchment, and spoon out the mix. You should have 6 biscuits per baking sheet, and they spread a lot <br>
                        Bake at 170C until there is a midium brown ring around the edge of each biscuit. About 6-8 minutes <br>

                        1l vegetable oil for frying <br>
                        Topping <br>
                        1 tbsp Coriander seeds <br>
                        1 tbsp Sesame seeds <br>
                        Tahini 15g in one third of mix <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Chopped everything in the mini food processor, then whipped it with the electric whisk <br>
                        Making the balls either by spooning straight into the oil or using the method here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLQfCXdr-g. Both were good and the video method was actually quite easy <br>
                        Tried making balls by rolling the dough in the hand, but the result was not as light and the outside less crispy <br>

                        Black pepper was good, as was extra salt and cumin <br>
                        Baking soda didn't add much <br>
                        Didn't like the tahini much. Better in sauce<br>

                        1l vegetable oil for frying <br>
                        Topping <br>
                        1 tbsp Coriander seeds <br>
                        1 tbsp Sesame seeds <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Chopped everything in the mini food processor, then whipped it with the electric whisk <br>
                        Making the balls either by spooning straight into the oil or using the method here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLQfCXdr-g. Both were good and the video method was actually quite easy <br>
                        Tried making balls by rolling the dough in the hand, but the result was not as light and the outside less crispy <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Could have had a little more spice in the mix, but maybe it's not supposed to <br>
                        Tiny bit more salt would also be good<br>
                        Try half a teaspoon black pepper <br>
                        Try with some tahini in the mix - 20g <br>
                        Try with baking soda (1 tsp) to imcrease fluffiness <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        Sauce: <br>
                        55g unsalted butter <br>
                        30g raw brown sugar <br>

                        1g salt <br>
                        Pudding: <br>
                        100g dates, roughly chopped <br>
                        1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br>
                        150ml boiling water <br>
                        25g unsalted butter, softened <br>
                        40g raw brown sugar <br>
                        40g light brown sugar <br>
                        1 egg <br>
                        15ml vanilla rum<br>
                        90g flour <br>
                        1g salt <br>
                        1/2 tsp baking powder <br>
                        Pinch of ground cloves <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Add the dates and baking soda to the boiling water. Bring to the boil, then leave to sit until the dates soften a bit <br>
                        Sauce: <br>
                        Meanwhile, make the sauce. Add everything to a pan and bring to the boil, then allow to bubble for a few minutes until it thickens <br>
                        Butter a 25*10cm pan, and pour half the sauce in the bottom and freeze <br>
                        Pudding: <br>
                        Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the egg and vanilla and beat well <br>
                        Blend the softened dates to a puree, and stir into the mix <br> 
                        Mix the flour, salt, baking powder and cloves together, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Take the pan out of the freezer, and pour the cake batter in <br>
                        Bake at 170C until just firm to the touch, about 30 minutes <br>
                        Poke holes in the cake with a skewer, and pour the remaining sauce over (needed to reheat) <br>
                        Grill or a few minutes, without burning<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Much better. The cake was a lot more moist<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        200g dried or 500g cooked black beans  <br>
                        1 teaspoon salt <br>

                        1 lime <br>
                        2 Chipotles in adobo <br>
                        400ml chicken stock <br>
                        salt <br>
                        100g sour cream <br>
                        half an avocado <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        If using dried beans, simmer them for about 2 hours until tender with 1 liter of water, 2 bay leaves and 1 tsp salt <br>
                        Discard the bay leaves, and keep the beans, garlic clove and about 200ml of the cooking water <br>
                        Fry the onion and pepper in a little oil for about 5 minutes until it softens <br>
                        Crush the garlic and add to the pan, along with the chipotles and the zest of the lime. Fry for another minute or so, until softened a bit but not browned <br>
                        Add the beans, bean cooking water and stock. Simmer for 15 minutes <br>
                        Blend until smooth <br>
                        Serve with a dollop of sour cream <br>
                        Dice the avocado and mix with the juice of the lime. Add on top of the sour cream, along with a little flaky salt  <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        40g butter, softened <br>
                        120g dates, roughly chopped <br>
                        0.75 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                        120g caster sugar <br>
                        1.5 eggs <br>
                        2 teaspoon vanilla rum <br>
                        120g flour <br>
                        1 teaspoon baking powder <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Boil the dates in 200ml water until soft. Add the baking soda and stir <br>
                        Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the eggs and beat well <br>
                        Mix in the date mixture and vanilla <br>
                        Mix the flour and baking powder together, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Butter a 20x10cm baking tim and pour the cake batter in <br>
                        Bake until just firm to the touch, about 30 minutes <br>
                        To make the sauce, boil the cream, sugar and treacle (molasses) together <br>
                        Cover the sponge with sauce (there will be some left over), then grill until it begins to bubble <br>
                        Cut into squares, and serve with the remaining sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream <br>
                        <br>

                        40g butter <br>
                        40g granulated sugar <br>

                        <br>
                        For the filling: <br>
                        Creme pat with 200ml milk <br>
                        150ml full cream <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, while whisking, and add in the milk.  <br>
                        Combine the flour, baking powder, and vanilla sugar in a medium bowl and add this to the mixture, whisking until combined.  <br>
                        <br>
                        In a clean, large stand mixer set to medium-low or a large mixing bowl whisk together the egg whites until foamy. Add the sugar a little at a time and continue to whisk until glossy, stiff peaks form.  <br>
                        <br>
                        Line the baking tin, spread the cake batter over the bottom of it, then top with the meringue and then the almonds. <br>
                        <br>
                        Gently pour the meringue evenly over the batter with a rubber spatula <br>
                        Place in the middle rack of the oven and bake until the meringue is dry and lightly golden (about 20 minutes)<br>
                        <br>
                        Make the creme pat and leave to chill. Then whip the cream, and gradually whip into the chilled creme pat<br>
                        <br>
                        Allow the cake to cool before filling <br>

                        Pretty good. Especially the creme diplomat <br>
                        I used vanilla rum as vanilla essence and sugar, and probably didn't have enough vanilla flavor <br>

                        1 chicken, in parts, legs deboned <br>
                        3 cloves garlic <br>
                        30g ginger root <br>

                        Fry until you worry about the marinade starting to burn, then transfer to a 200C oven until fully cooked <br>

                        Pulling the meat from the bone is just too tedious to make it worth doing regularly though. Maybe shank could be used? Or maybe cooking longer would make the pulling easier. <br>
                        Would also be interesting to cure the meat a bit by salting it for a few days <br>

                        Pretty good. Something was slightly bitter in the sauce - could have been the frozen mussels, or maybe the vegatables weren't cooked quite enough <br> <br>
                        Would try again, but with fresh instead of frozen mussels<br>
                        May also have been the amount of cheap wine, making it a bit sour. I think i used the cheapest wine, and maybe more than i needed. <br>

                        125g walnuts <br>
                        125g hazelnuts <br>
                        150g butter <br>
                        200g brown sugar <br>
                        2 eggs <br>
                        1 egg yolk <br>
                        100g plain flour <br>
                        1 tsp baking powder <br>
                        3g salt <br>
                        1tbsp instant coffee, dissolved in as little hot water as possible <br>
                        30ml vanilla rum <br>
                        100ml oil <br>
                        ICING <br>
                        160g icing sugar <br>
                        80g butter <br>
                        1 teaspoon instant coffee <br>
                        1 tsp vanilla rum <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Roast the nuts, then chop the walnuts, and grind the hazelnuts into powder <br>
                        Cream the butter and sugar, stir in the nuts, and gradually beat in the eggs <br>
                        Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Combine the coffee vanilla and oil, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Bake at 160C until done (around 40 minutes) <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Really happy with this <br>
                        The oil is a good addition as the cake is very moist, although i think i overdid it a bit. I reduced the oil and butter in the recipe a bit. <br>
                        It uses less coffee in the cake than some of the other recipes I tried. This seems good - the other recipes used a huge amount of coffee, but even then the flavor was a bit lost. Relying on the coffee icing for coffee flavor seems to be better. <br>

                        Fry the chicken in the oil over medium high heat until slightly browned (no neet to remove the marinade from the chicken)s<br>
                        Remove from pan, the fry the onion alog with the bay in the same pan<br>
                        Add the salt, rice, coconut milk and water. Place the chicken on top, then bring to boil, cover, turn heat right down and cook for about 15 minutes until the rice is done <br>

                        Great! Could also have some green vegetables in there - beans, peas etc. <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        70g unsalted butter<br>
                        4 egg yolks<br>
                        120g light brown sugar<br>
                        20g raw sugar<br>
                        1.5g salt <br>
                        150ml whole milk <br>
                        seeds of 1 vanilla pod <br>
                        400ml double cream  <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Brown the butter in a saucepan until medium brown, allow to cool a bit and beat into the eggs, sugar and salt<br>
                        Heat the milk with the vanilla <br>
                        Make a custard with the milk and eggs <br>
                        Stir in the double cream <br>
                        Chill and churn <br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Really good. Maybe could reduce the cream a bit and increase the milk as it's very rich. <br>

                        <br>

                        As recipe <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Good texture. <br>
                        Coffee flavor was good enough, although it felt a bit one dimensional. Maybe partly due to oil instead of butter<br>
                        Brown sugar would have been an improvement. <br>
                        As a non iced cake, it would need more sugar. With the sweet white chocolate icing, it should be fine<br>
                        Could use some vanilla in there too, and maybe some alcohol <br><br>
                        In general, the other coffee cake from river cafe was better. Neither had super strong coffee flavor, so maybe it's better to reduce the coffee in the cake and have most of the coffee flavor coming from the icing. For texture, trying 2/3 butter, 1/3 oil wold be interesting.

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        200ml water <br>
                        80g butter <br>
                        5g sugar <br>
                        2g salt <br>
                        170g eggs <br>
                        1 egg (for the glazing) <br>
                        100g white bread flour <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Put the water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan, bring to the simmer<br>
                        Take off the heat, dump the flour in, and quickly whisk together until combined <br>
                        Place back on a moderate heat, and cook while stirring until a crust forms over the bottom of the saucepan <br>
                        Leave to cool a bit (you can beat it a bit to speed this up), then beat in the eggs one at a time (it will split and then come together as you add each egg). You should add the egg slowly toward the end until it reaches the correct consistency. The correct consistency occurs has been reached when you can hold a big spoonful sidewards, and it falls off slowly in a single large blob<br>
                        Pipe into the desired shape<br>
                        Knock off any tips by wetting your finger and poking them, before glazing with the final beaten egg <br>
                        Cook at 200C fan for about 30 minutes, until well browned <br>
                        <br>

                        Great. <br>
                        There are a lot of variations in this: <br> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>butter can be between 50% and 100% of the flour weight (eclair de genie suggests 100%). More butter gives more crispness and flavor, although maybe more softness too (just my theory)</li>
                            <li>it's more common to use half milk, half water (eclair de genie). More milk is said to give flavour and color, while more water should give a crisper result</li>
                            <li>sugar is not standard, but i guess it works for sweet recipes</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        Other Notes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>bread flour likely makes it crisper</li>
                            <li>weights are more important than number of eggs</li>
                            <li>judging based on consistency is more important than exact weight of eggs etc.</li>
                            <li>resting choux after piping is a good thing - 15 or 20 minutes is enough. It forms a slight crust which tends to give a more even rise</li>
                            <li>to get more evenly browned choux, you can take it out of the oven 5 minutes before it's done, let it cool, and then put it back in to finish</li>
                            <li>poking a few holes after baking is done will help release steam and give a crisper result</li>
                            <li>choux that has gone soft can be refreshed by quickly baking again</li>
                            <li>securing your paper with a dot of pastry in each corner makes piping a lot easier</li>
                            <li>a large many pointed star tip is typically used for piping eclairs</li>
                            <li>christophe adam uses vanilla in the pastry (8g liquid per 100g flour)</li>
                        </ul>

                        Zest the remaining lemons and put the zest in a saucepan with the sugar and 100ml of the water. Bring to the boil to make a syrup <br>

                        Add in the strawberries and the gin and blend again thoroughly <br>
                        Gradually add in the juice of the remaining lemon, tasting as you go <br>
                        Chill the mix, and then churn <br>
                        <br>

                        5 bay leaves <br>
                        6 cloves <br>
                        140g butter <br>

                        In a separate pan, fry the onion in butter until soft, then add the ham and fry another minute <br>
                        Add the flour, and fry a few minutes more <br>
                        Add the milk, nutmeg, and pepper <br>

                        Didn't do this: Whisk the egg yolks, and then mix a little of the bechamel into them before adding back into the rest of the bechamel<br>

                        2/3 tonka bean <br>

                        Sieve the mix to remove tonka bean particles <br>

                        70g butter <br>
                        1/3 large onion <br>
                        110g serrano ham<br>
                        60g flour <br>
                        1/4 nutmeg, grated <br>
                        pinch of ground white pepper <br>
                        5.6g salt <br>
                        1 egg <br>
                        100 g breadcrumbs <br>
                        Light olive oil or vegetable oil for deep-frying <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Bring milk to the boil along with bay and cloves, then leave to infuse <br>
                        In a separate pan, fry the onion in butter until soft, then add the ham and fry another minute <br>
                        Add the flour, and fry a few minutes more <br>
                        Add the milk, nutmeg, and pepper and cook stirring constantly until well thickened, losing around 300g ( 286g to be exact )<br>
                        Whisk the egg yolks, and then mix a little of the bechamel into them before adding back into the rest of the bechamel<br>
                        content weight 1009g <br>

                        They ended up too salty, but more or less everything else was good <br>
                        Try 3g salt next time (although it will always depends a bit on the ham) <br>
                        Info: Serrano ham is about 5% salt - so 110g = 5.5g salt <br> 
                        Info: Cooked ham is about 2.5% salt - so 110g = 5.5g salt <br>

                        Pretty sure it was blending the cream that caused the issue last time, by turning it into butter<br>
                        Next time, could reduce the cream to 150ml, and the sugar to 90g. Could also try adding the lemon juice again<br>

                        Not sure if it was split because of acid, or because i blended the cream. In any case, it had split before it started freezing<br>
                        Next time, would try stirring the cream rather than blending <br>

                        It wasn't super brown after the first boil - a golden syrup color, so maybe should have given it a while longer. Also wasn't thickened, but recipe didn't say it had to <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        400g raspberries <br>
                        50g sugar <br>
                        1 tbsp flour <br>
                        0.5 tbsp cornflour <br>
                        juice of 0.5 lemon <br>
                        200g oats <br>
                        190g flour <br>
                        200g brown sugar <br>
                        0.5 tsp baking powder <br>
                        100g butter, melted <br>
                        80g coconut fat, melted  <br>
                        0.25 tsp salt <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        More or less according to recipe. The only difference is using coconut fat and butter instead of only butter <br><br>
                        Defrost and strain raspberries, then mix with sugar, flour, cornflour, lemon <br>
                        Mix the rest into crumble <br>
                        Bake two thirds of the crumble mix in a lined pan (blue one) for 10 minutes at 160C fan <br>
                        Tip raspberry mix on top, followed by the rest of the crumble, and bake for 25 minutes more <br>
                        Let cool down and slice <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Not bad - raspberry flapjack basically <br>
                        Needs a less raspberry (probably half is enough), and the raspberry mix should be sweeter <br>

                        450g chicken livers, cleaned <br>
                        180g butter, diced <br>
                        1 shallot, finely chopped <br>
                        1 tsp thyme leaves, finely chopped <br>
                        90ml cognac <br>
                        40ml double cream <br>
                        6g tsp salt <br>
                        1/3 tsp ground allspice <br>
                        1/3 tsp ground ginger <br>
                        3 tsp green peppercorns <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Fry shallots and thyme with a knob of the butter until soft, then empty into blender <br>
                        Fry chicken livers quickly until browned, but very pink inside. Add to blender<br>
                        Add cognac to pan and reduce to syrup. Add to the blender<br>
                        Add the spices, salt, cream and remaining butter to the blender<br>
                        Blend until smooth, then sieve<br>
                        Fold in the peppercorns and transfer to final dish<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Much better. Consistency was much better because of the extra butter and less cream <br>
                        Cognac is much better than grand marnier <br>
                        Peppercorns are good, but maybe 2 teaspoons would be enough <br>

                        Too creamy - maybe cut that down to 30ml. Increase the butter to add fat, and solidify more <br>
                        Grand Marnier was a mistake - too sweet - cognac would be better <br>
                        Spices are ok - bit more salt would be good - try 4.5g <br>

                        2 oranges (medium blond)<br>
                        40g butter <br>

                        2 egg yolks <br>
                        2tsp vanilla <br>

                        Dip oranges in sugar <br>
                        Add 80g sugar to 25*20cm tray, and put oranges on top. Keep rest of sugar aside<br>
                        Bake at 210 until sugar browning <br>
                        Remove and reserve the sugar, then quarter the oranges and return them to oven until they get quite dark brown (chocolatey shade) <br>

                        Not amazing, but interesting and pretty good. Bitter, but not too bitter - might go well with something very sweet <br>

                        700g ground beef siedfleisch (about 20% fat) <br>

                        Made according to the recipe. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Pretty good overall - I think I slightly preferred this over marcella hazans<br>
                        It tasted really good before adding the fish sauce and parmesan at the end, and worse after. So, I would skip the fish sauce, and carefully taste while adding the parmesan <br>
                        I oversalted a bit early on, so be careful of this<br>
                        The pork/beef/pancetta mix was definitely better than just beef. The coarse grind from the person at the meat counter was definitely good too <br>
                        Gelatine was great, the sauce had a nice consistency <br>
                        The method was easy, but I would need a bigger oven dish to cook it all <br>

                        I only basted once with BBQ sauce, toward the end. Next time - More basting more better. <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        2 liters water <br>
                        10 * 12cm kombu <br>
                        40g bonito flakes <br>
                        100g miso paste (caramel color) (optional)<br>
                        20ml mirin  <br>
                        tofu <br>
                        dried wakame <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Heat cold water with kombu until boiling <br>
                        Turn off heat, remove kombu, add bonito, let steep for 2 minutes then strain. Now you have dashi<br>
                        Whisk the miso paste into the dashi and add the mirin <br>
                        Serve with some tofu cubes and about half a teaspoon dried wakame per cup <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>   
                        Not bad, but could have been a bit stronger flavor. Maybe needed some extra kombu in the dashi, and letting the bonito flakes simmer in it for a while (not much though, as most recipes don't, or just very briefly)<br>
                        Some suggest soaking the kombu in the water overnight before making the dashi <br>
                        note: shouldn't let the water boil when the kombu is in the water. Take it out just before boiling (this is in all the recipes, and seems important) <br>

                        butter <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Flatten chicken - wing tips off, wishbone out, remove breast bone, cut around remaining bones. Basically get as flat as possible and o that all skin is on one side so it can be fried on that <br>
                        Salt with 1% salt by weight, and leave in fridge <br>
                        Put skin side down in a cold pan, and slowly fry over medium-low heat until skin is super golden crispy and chicken is nearly cooked through <br>
                        Flip it, and add butter, garlic and thyme, and continue frying until cooked through <br>

                        150ml heavy cream <br>
                        1 tsp salt <br>
                        1 tablespoon parsley <br>
                        3 tablespoons grated parmesan <br>

                        Mix all to nutmeg, and leave to stand for 10 minutes <br>

                        bit too bready - 25g inside would be enough, then reduce the cream to 100g <br>
                        should add some more herbs - oregano or rosemary <br>
                        can skip the breadcrumb coating <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Hung 244g of Migros Cream Cheese in cheesecloth <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>After 6 hours with some light squeezing</strong>, the cheese had lost 50g water or 20% <br>

                        Best result so far with this icing - much thicker than previous attempts. <br>
                        Next time would try with less sugar. <br>

                        Decent enough, but nothing to get too excited about. It's quite a lot of fuss between ingredients, cooking time &amp; steps, so probably not worth it <br>

                        5 eggs <br>
                        45ml dashi <br>
                        60ml cream <br>
                        20g brown sugar <br>
                        10ml light soy sauce (should be white, a.k.a. shiro) <br>
                        2 tablespoons mirin <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Mix everything with the stick blender and leave overnight in the fridge <br>
                        Remix, before putting in baking pan <br>
                        Cook 10 minutes at 150C, then reduce heat to 100C and continued cooking until slightly jiggly in center, with a temp of 80C.  <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Technically, was good <br>
                        In the recipe it should brown on top, which mine didn't really, but I don't think that's a big issue <br>
                        Flavorwise, it might be a bit strong on soy and sugar. Not sure it's better than rolled omelette and might be more delicate<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        4 eggs, separated <br>
                        160g caster sugar <br>
                        150g ground almonds <br>
                        finely grated zest of 2 oranges <br>
                        juice of 5 oranges, preferably Seville <br>
                        juice of 1 lemon (if not using Seville oranges) <br>
                        1 stick cinnamon <br>
                        caster sugar to taste <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Heat oven to 180C and Line Pan. <br>
                        Put a tablespoon of the caster sugar in with the egg whites <br>
                        Beat the rest of the caster sugar with the egg yolks until pale <br>
                        Mix in the almonds and zest <br>
                        Beat the egg whites and sugar until stiff and then fold into the egg mixture <br>
                        Bake for about 60-70 minutes until golden on top and firm to the touch <br>
                        <br>
                        To make some orange syrup, gently simmer the orange juice, lemon juice, cinnamon and a handful of sugar for about five minutes. Taste for sugar – the syrup should be quite tart. Allow to cool <br>
                        <br>
                        When the cake is ready, remove it from the oven and allow to cool before opening the spring-form tin <br>
                        Transfer it to a plate and pierce holes in the top <br>
                        Soak about up to about half of the syrup into the torta <br>
                        <br>
                        Serve the remaining syrup on the side <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Technical problems, but taste was good. <br>
                        Looks nothing like the one on the guardian page <br>
                        Rose and sank pretty severely, leaving it looking like a skateboarding bowl. Maybe less egg white....or more?...internet suggests both. Seemed overly full in the first place. <br>
                        Overcooked on top and bottom. Probably should reduce cooking temp a bit <br>
                        <br><br>
                        Did various syrups with 50g sugar, 500ml orange juice, 40ml lemon juice (reduced by, 35%, 50%, 60%, 70%). 50% reduced might be good for penetrating the cake, and 60% reduced would be good for serving with the cake. <br>
                        Few flaked almonds or pistachios on top would help appearance <br>
                        If I can't stop this collapsing, one option would be to cut the top off and flip it. Possibly also candied orange slices in the bottom which would then be the top. <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        250g Spinach or Chard <br>
                        1⁄2 small onion, finely chopped <br>
                        3 slices prosciutto, finely chopped <br>
                        25g butter <br>
                        150g ricotta <br>
                        1 egg yolk <br>
                        30g grated parmesan <br>
                        2 pinches grated nutmeg <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        Sweat the onion and proscuitto in the butter until cooked <br>
                        Add the spinach, fry and taste for salt <br>
                        In a bowl, mix the ricotta, egg yolk, parmesan and nutmeg <br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Suggestion is to serve this with tomato sauce, but it masked the flavour a bit. I would go for cream next time<br>

                        This was better than the previous attempt without the ricotta. Might have had too much ricotta though, or maybe could have used an egg yolk to stabilize the filling <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        170g Chocolate 70%  <br>
                        2.5 eggs <br>
                        112g butter <br>
                        105g caster sugar <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Eggs + 35g sugar beaten until volume quadruples <br>
                        Melt chocolate and butter <br>
                        Make syrup from remaining sugar + 50ml water  <br>
                        Add syrup to choc and let cool a bit <br>
                        Add the chocolate to the eggs, and beat slowly until the mixture is combined <br>
                        Pour into the tin <br>
                        Bain marie at 120C until top is set and you can bring it a bit away from the sides (maybe 50 minutes for 25cm tin) <br>
                        Took out of the oven after 45 minutes. Top was set, inner temp was 80C, could just about persuade it away from the sides of the tin  <br>
                        Chill completely in fridge <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        maybe could cook it slightly more - try until 85C <br>
                        initially thought it wasn't cooked enough, as it was more like mousse when still warm. But after chilling in the fridge, it was good <br>
                        should try with some really good chocolate <br>

                        Could have had a little more sugar. maybe 25g <br>
                        Mandarin peel affected the texture quite a lot - tasted like it had oatmeal in it <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        CAKE <br>
                        60g chopped walnuts <br>
                        60g jacutinga sugar <br>
                        60g light brown sugar <br>
                        40g honey <br>
                        40g granulated sugar <br>
                        100ml peanut oil  <br>
                        2 eggs <br>
                        1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>
                        140g all-purpose flour  <br>
                        1 teaspoons baking powder <br>
                        1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                        2g teaspoon salt <br>
                        1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon <br>
                        1/4 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
                        3/4 teaspoon cardamom <br>
                        1/4 tsp allspice <br>
                        60g grated apple <br>
                        150g grated carrots <br>
                        30ml grand marnier <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Roasted nuts, mix wet ingredients, mix dry ingredients, combine, add rest, bake at 160C <br>
                        Cooking time - 45 minutes @160C No fan, shelf just below middle. <br>
                        Cake notes when taking out - 96C about 1cm from bottom, to 93C at top. Quiet Rice Krispie type sizzling. Firm to touch. Coming away from top. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Bake color looks better - deep brown but no suggestion of burning <br>
                        Can i notice the alcohol? Not really, could try going to  or just forget it<br>
                        alcohol affect texture? Nope<br>
                        More carrotty? Maybe a bit. Not really noticeable, but would keep it at 150<br>
                        How is the spice? Cardamom good? Better, could have a bit more overall - Ginger is now more background, which is good<br>
                        Any saltiness? Nope. 2g is no problem<br>
                        Orange Zest on icing worth adding? Yep<br>

                        75g full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature <br>
                        20g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
                        90g confectioners’ sugar <br>

                        As recipe, with substitutions for pecans (walnuts), dark brown sugar (jacutinga, LBS, honey) and applesauce (shredded apple). <br>
                        Made one deep 18cm cake <br>
                        Cooking time - 45 minutes <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Got a bit too brown on top, might be better cooking at 160C instead of 170C <br>
                        Pretty good. Probably should have a bit more salt(maybe 1.5x), and a bit more carrot too, maybe 150g<br>
                        maybe a bit of alcohol - grand marnier could work <br>
                        orange zest? <br>
                        Was better next day, and from the fridge the icing tastes better too <br>
                        Cream cheese should be the one in th brick form, which does seem to be significantly different to the one in the tub. Not sure if it can be found here...recipes are available on youtube <br>
                        Some recipes used a bit of cornflour to thicken the icing <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients</strong> (for 18cm cake)<br>
                        88g dried figs, finely chopped <br>
                        48ml Armagnac or Cognac <br>
                        88g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped. <br>
                        115g hazelnuts, roasted and skins removed <br>
                        48ml dried breadcrumbs <br>
                        88g stick unsalted butter, softened <br>
                        105g granulated sugar <br>
                        Pinch of salt <br>
                        2.5 large eggs, lightly beaten <br>
                        <br>
                        Glaze: <br>
                        60g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped <br>
                        50g lindor<br>
                        144g full cream<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        cooked without fan for 20 minutes at 160C and 20 minutes at 190C. (recipe said 30 minutes at 190C, but i misread) <br>
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        A bit overcooked, slightly burned around the sides. So 190C is probably too hot<br>
                        Not sure about the chunks of dried figs - they have some quite hard pieces. Maybe they should be soaked in the alcohol much longer, or blended with it<br>
                        Alcohol adds something really good <br>
                        The ganache on the top is quite good too. I fucked it up a bit, by not adding the full amounts (should have used 88g 70% choc and 66g lindor) <br><br>
                        Try again? <br>
                        Defintely worth a second try due to overcooking, and potential inprovements above <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        As recipe, but with using a bit of the instant coffee powder in crushed form, and vanilla extract & paste instead of beans<br>
                        18cm cake. half recipe<br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        As recipe <br>
                        160C No fan. Baked on the shelf that's a bit below the middle of the oven <br>
                        took out when digital thermometer showed 99C deep into the cake and about 94 near the surface <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Done Check: 40 minutes - Not even close. Done after 55<br>
                        Tasted good, and better the next day<br>
                        Should try again with all the coffee crushed, it's easier than dissolving and means less mess and liquid <br>
                        Not super strong coffer flavor, but kept me awake :-D <br>
                        Brown sugar would be good, maybe even some raw <br>
                        Moist enough to eat alone, but maybe some icing to increase the coffee flavor would be good<br>
                        Didn't get that much vanilla from it. Maybe could have some vanilla extract injected into it or sprayed on it before serving<br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        as recipe, but without pepper<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Flavor combination was generally good - worth trying in other recipes <br>
                        Chicken was fine - would have been better presalted like zuni chicken. <br>
        <br>
                        Correctly salted and with pepper would have made it to a 7 or 8<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        70g butter<br>
                        1/2 large onion<br>
                        200g mix landrauchschinken & serrano<br>
                        800ml milk<br>
                        60g flour<br>
                        pinch of freshly grated nutmeg <br>
                        1 teaspoon salt <br>
                        pinch of ground white pepper (ground black pepper will also do) <br>
                        2 eggs  <br>
                        100 g breadcrumbs <br>
                        Light olive oil  or vegetable oil for deep-frying <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        As in recipe. fry onion in butter, fry ham in butter, add flour and give five minutes, add nutmeg. gradually add milk and simmer half an hour until thick<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Too much ham<br>
                        Consistency and breadcrumbs good<br>
                        Careful with the salt,don't add it until the bechamel is fully cooked, as the ham adds saltiness<br>
                        The landrauchschinken is too smoky<br>
                        Next time 120g unsmoked ham, and 1/3 large onion<br>

                        1 onion<br>
                        1 tbsp butter<br>
                        200 gram ground beef<br>
                        300g ground pork (original recipe was 200g beef, 100g pork, 100g veal, but this was what i could find)<br>
                        3 tablespoons bread crumbs<br>
                        200ml heavy cream<br>
                        1 egg<br>
                        1 tsp salt<br>
                        Pinch of cinnamon<br>
                        A pinch of grounded nutmeg<br>
                        A pinch of grounded nutmeg<br>
                        1 tbsp cooking oil + 1 tbsp butter for pan frying<br>
                        cranberry jam and quick pickled cucumbers to serve<br>

                        Pretty good. <br>
                        The real recipe should be with lingonberries as the jam is too sweet<br>
                        And the pickled cucumbers could be a bit less sweet than the standard recipe<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        380 gm softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing<br>
                        380 gm caster sugar<br>
                        380 gm blanched whole almonds, finely ground<br>
                        3 vanilla beans - substitute for 7 teaspoons vanilla paste & 3 teaspoons homemade vanilla extract<br>
                        5 large eggs<br>
                        200 gm walnuts, finely chopped<br>
                        100 gm (2/3 cup) plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br>
                        ½ tsp baking powder<br>
                        125 ml amaretto<br>
        <br>
                        120g 70% chocolate<br>
                        30g butter<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        As recipe, but reduced to 80% and used 8 inch tin instean of 10. realised later that the recipe should really be reduced to 64% for 8 inch rather than 10 inch tin<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Took cake out after 1 hour. Signs of readiness - 1) with probe showing 107C 2)skewer cleanish with few microcrumbs stuck. 3)shrinking very slightly away from the edge of the pan. <br>
                        Probably cooked more or less the right amount - an extra few minutes wouldn't have done any harm either. Seemed maybe a bit too moist when still warm, 10 minutes from the oven. Cooling on cake rack might have been enough to reduce moisture a bit.<br>

                        Made according to the recipe. <br>
                        Notes from another recipe on Italia Squista: The meat mix here is 150g pancetta, 150g pork, 500g beef. They use a meat grinder to mince the vegetables finely along with some pancetta, and mince the beef and pork coarsely. They don't use dairy, but I like the dairy so fuck that. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Pretty good - Should definitely try with the pork though. The vegetable size wasn't really an issue, so chopping them by hand rather than mincing is fine. <br>

                        Made according to the recipe, frying off chicken in casserole while doing mushrooms in frying pan. Left chicken skin mostly on - not sure it thats a good idea or not<br>

                        Trying my version of La Cucina Italia's tiramisu, with less egg yolk and sugar. Used 100ml coffee per 100g biscuits as it was hard to make them soak less.<br> <br>
                        3 egg whites<br>
                        2 egg yolks<br>
                        55g Sugar<br>
                        250g Mascarpone<br>
                        1 tbsp Gran Marnier<br>
                        100g Savoiardi Biscuits<br>
                        100ml strong coffee<br>
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Too soggy. 100ml coffee to 100g biscuits was too much. Coffee probably not strong enough<br>
                        Sugar was better. Could go up to 60g<br>
                        Less egg yolk seemed good - maybe now there's less sugar it would be worth trying again with the extra yolk<br>
                        Could have few more biscuits too. Probably 150g biscuits to 100ml coffee would be good<br>

                        Made this, but with 2tbsp grand marnier instead of 4tbsp marsala<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Generally very good, but maybe a bit too sweet and slightly too many egg yolks making it richer than necesary<br>

                        300g salmon <br>
                        1/2 small beetroot<br>
                        Zest of 1 orange<br>
                        Zest of 1 lemon<br>
                        Large bunch of dill<br>
                        32g kosher salt<br>
                        30g sugar<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Mix everything bar the dill and coat the salmon with the mixture. <br>
                        Refrigerate for 24 hours, covered in plastic and weighted down with something.<br>
                        Rinse the cure away, and let sit another half day in the fridge to allow salt to redistribute a bit.<br>
                        Cover with finely chopped dill and serve.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Too salty, and not sure the beetroot brings much except color. <br>
                        Should try again reducing either the salt or the cure time. (serious eats cure is 40g salt 25g sugar 900g salmon for 2 days)<br>
                        White pepper is also a common addition. Coriander may also be good<br>

                        Need to be careful with the batter as it wants to leak through even very small gaps in the pan. Had to use the cheaper pan as it sealed better<br>

                        Was a bit too oily - some suggested to use better quality oil, the other option would be to reduce the oil<br>
                        Could also have done with a bit more orange flavor <br>
