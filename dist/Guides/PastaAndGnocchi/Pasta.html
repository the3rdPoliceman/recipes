Not too long though or it cracks when cutting</div><div>For lasagna cut sheets the size of the pan if possible so you don't have to jigsaw it when assembling, but then once ready to cook cut the whole lasagna into portions before baking it</div><div class="guide-section">Cooking</div><div>Fresh pasta needs saltier water than dried, as it cooks so quickly</div><div>Don't drain using a colander - take the pasta out of the pot with tongs or a spider.
