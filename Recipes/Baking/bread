bread 

DAY 1  
mix these together in a big bowl and leave overnight
	200g water
	200g flour
	1/4 teaspoon dried yeast

DAY 2.
The stuff from yesterday will look like a swamp by now.
Mix these things into yesterdays swamp, one at a time
	175g water
	1/2 teaspoon dried yeast
	2 teaspoons fine salt
	300g flour
It'll still be pretty wet. Leave for 30 minutes

FOLDING
oil your hands so the dough doesn't stick to you
grab one side of the dough, stretch it a bit and fold it onto the other (like you're closing a stretchy book), then turn the bowl 90 degrees
repeat 15-20 times
Leave until it doubles in size (maybe 90 mins)

SHAPING 
Flour a work surface and flip the dough out onto it. Then shape it - this video from the 2:00 minutes shows how (The idea is to get some tension into the surface of the loaf)

Cover a tea towel in flour, put the dough on the tea towel, and put the whole thing in a bowl. Like this - https://blossomandsunshine.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sourdough-2.jpg
Leave it for an hour

BAKING
Heat the over to 230C
put baking paper or flour onto a baking tray
flip the dough onto the tray 
slash a cross into the top of it, like this - https://files.recipetips.com/kitchen/images/refimages/bread/prep/shaping/coburg_slash_2.jpg
If you have a big metal bowl, cover the dough with that - it'll help it to puff up more
Put it in the oven 
After 20 minutes, turn the heat down to 200C, and take the metal bowl off
Cook until it's pretty dark brown
