Recipe (Current)
Stage 1 - Infusion
1 liter alcohol - As Pure as possible (Spirytus, Grain Alcohol etc.)
zest of 20 lemons - lemons should be unwaxed if possible.  If only waxed lemons are available, lemons should be washed in warm water and scrubbed to remove wax. 
Mix alcohol & lemon zest in jar.  leave somewhere dark for 2-3 weeks (maybe until peel goes pale?), shaking every 2-3 days)
Stage 2 - Balancing with Sugar Solution
1kg Sugar (to taste)
Water
The general consensus is 50% alcohol to 50% water.  It seems sensible to add sugar to taste.  
Add a basic sugar syrup which will include most of the necessary water, and a minimum necessary amount of sugar - 720ml water/250g sugar 
Adjust sweetness with a saturated sugar syrup solution - 175ml water/550g sugar
Make total water content up to 1 liter....or not.
Boil syrup to dissolve sugar, cool and add strained alcohol
Stage 3 - Bottling
Put into sterilized bottles (see appendix for info on sterilizing), using a funnel with coffee filters to remove any crap.  Store in the freezer
