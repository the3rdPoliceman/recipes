Chorizo, Tomato, Cream Pasta
Ingredients
Olive oil
half a tin of tomatoes
1 clove Garlic
Chopped Rosemary
Chorizo
pinch dried red chilli flakes
Cream
Pasta
Parmesan and Maybe Basil
Method
Oil, tomatoes, garlic and rosemary in the pan, with a bit of salt and pepper.  Cook the tomatoes until they have begun to soften - about 5 minutes.
Add the sausage and chilli flakes, and enough cream to leave the sauce still rich in colour. Simmer very gently for about 10 minutes. 
Parmesan on top, maybe a bit of basil too
