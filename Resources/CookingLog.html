                Decent enough, but nothing to get too excited about. It's quite a lot of fuss between ingredients, cooking time &amp; steps, so probably not worth it <br>

            <div class="log-detail">
                Ingredients:<br>
                5 eggs <br>
                45ml dashi <br>
                60ml cream <br>
                20g brown sugar <br>
                10ml light soy sauce (should be white, a.k.a. shiro) <br>
                2 tablespoons mirin <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Mix everything with the stick blender and leave overnight in the fridge <br>
                Remix, before putting in baking pan <br>
                Cook 10 minutes at 150C, then reduce heat to 100C and continued cooking until slightly jiggly in center, with a temp of 80C.  <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Technically, was good <br>
                In the recipe it should brown on top, which mine didn't really, but I don't think that's a big issue <br>
                Flavorwise, it might be a bit strong on soy and sugar. Not sure it's better than rolled omelette and might be more delicate<br>

                40g Butter <br>
                1/4 Onion, finely sliced <br>

            <div class="log-detail">
                Ingredients:<br>
                4 eggs, separated <br>
                160g caster sugar <br>
                150g ground almonds <br>
                finely grated zest of 2 oranges <br>
                juice of 5 oranges, preferably Seville <br>
                juice of 1 lemon (if not using Seville oranges) <br>
                1 stick cinnamon <br>
                caster sugar to taste <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Heat oven to 180C and Line Pan. <br>
                Put a tablespoon of the caster sugar in with the egg whites <br>
                Beat the rest of the caster sugar with the egg yolks until pale <br>
                Mix in the almonds and zest <br>
                Beat the egg whites and sugar until stiff and then fold into the egg mixture <br>
                Bake for about 60-70 minutes until golden on top and firm to the touch <br>
                <br>
                To make some orange syrup, gently simmer the orange juice, lemon juice, cinnamon and a handful of sugar for about five minutes. Taste for sugar – the syrup should be quite tart. Allow to cool <br>
                <br>
                When the cake is ready, remove it from the oven and allow to cool before opening the spring-form tin <br>
                Transfer it to a plate and pierce holes in the top <br>
                Soak about up to about half of the syrup into the torta <br>
                <br>
                Serve the remaining syrup on the side <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Technical problems, but taste was good. <br>
                Looks nothing like the one on the guardian page <br>
                Rose and sank pretty severely, leaving it looking like a skateboarding bowl. Maybe less egg white....or more?...internet suggests both. Seemed overly full in the first place. <br>
                Overcooked on top and bottom. Probably should reduce cooking temp a bit <br>
                <br><br>
                Did various syrups with 50g sugar, 500ml orange juice, 40ml lemon juice (reduced by, 35%, 50%, 60%, 70%). 50% reduced might be good for penetrating the cake, and 60% reduced would be good for serving with the cake. <br>
                Few flaked almonds or pistachios on top would help appearance <br>
                If I can't stop this collapsing, one option would be to cut the top off and flip it. Possibly also candied orange slices in the bottom which would then be the top. <br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                250g Spinach or Chard <br>
                1⁄2 small onion, finely chopped <br>
                3 slices prosciutto, finely chopped <br>
                25g butter <br>
                150g ricotta <br>
                1 egg yolk <br>
                30g grated parmesan <br>
                2 pinches grated nutmeg <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                <br>
                Sweat the onion and proscuitto in the butter until cooked <br>
                Add the spinach, fry and taste for salt <br>
                In a bowl, mix the ricotta, egg yolk, parmesan and nutmeg <br>
                Let the spinach cool a bit, mix everything together, and taste for salt &amp; nutmeg <br>
                Result:<br>
                Suggestion is to serve this with tomato sauce, but it masked the flavour a bit. I would go for cream next time<br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                170g Chocolate 70%  <br>
                2.5 eggs <br>
                112g butter <br>
                105g caster sugar <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Eggs + 35g sugar beaten until volume quadruples <br>
                Melt chocolate and butter <br>
                Make syrup from remaining sugar + 50ml water  <br>
                Add syrup to choc and let cool a bit <br>
                Add the chocolate to the eggs, and beat slowly until the mixture is combined <br>
                Pour into the tin <br>
                Bain marie at 120C until top is set and you can bring it a bit away from the sides (maybe 50 minutes for 25cm tin) <br>
                Took out of the oven after 45 minutes. Top was set, inner temp was 80C, could just about persuade it away from the sides of the tin  <br>
                Chill completely in fridge <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                maybe could cook it slightly more - try until 85C <br>
                initially thought it wasn't cooked enough, as it was more like mousse when still warm. But after chilling in the fridge, it was good <br>
                should try with some really good chocolate <br>

                Could have had a little more sugar. maybe 25g <br>
                Mandarin peel affected the texture quite a lot - tasted like it had oatmeal in it <br>

                could have something eytra orangy added when serving - seems too moist to take syrup (unless it was purposely cooked a bit longer than necessary?). Or maybe zest<br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                CAKE <br>
                60g chopped walnuts <br>
                60g jacutinga sugar <br>
                60g light brown sugar <br>
                40g honey <br>
                40g granulated sugar <br>
                100ml peanut oil  <br>
                2 eggs <br>
                1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>
                140g all-purpose flour  <br>
                1 teaspoons baking powder <br>
                1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                2g teaspoon salt <br>
                1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon <br>
                1/4 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
                3/4 teaspoon cardamom <br>
                1/4 tsp allspice <br>
                60g grated apple <br>
                150g grated carrots <br>
                30ml grand marnier <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Roasted nuts, mix wet ingredients, mix dry ingredients, combine, add rest, bake at 160C <br>
                Cooking time - 45 minutes @160C No fan, shelf just below middle. <br>
                Cake notes when taking out - 96C about 1cm from bottom, to 93C at top. Quiet Rice Krispie type sizzling. Firm to touch. Coming away from top. <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Bake color looks better - deep brown but no suggestion of burning <br>
                Can i notice the alcohol? Not really, could try going to  or just forget it<br>
                alcohol affect texture? Nope<br>
                More carrotty? Maybe a bit. Not really noticeable, but would keep it at 150<br>
                How is the spice? Cardamom good? Better, could have a bit more overall - Ginger is now more background, which is good<br>
                Any saltiness? Nope. 2g is no problem<br>
                Orange Zest on icing worth adding? Yep<br>

                ICING <br>
                75g full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature <br>
                20g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
                90g confectioners’ sugar <br>
                1/2 teaspoon heavy cream or milk <br>
                1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
                pinch of salt, to taste <br>

                Method:<br>
                As recipe, with substitutions for pecans (walnuts), dark brown sugar (jacutinga, LBS, honey) and applesauce (shredded apple). <br>
                Made one deep 18cm cake <br>
                Cooking time - 45 minutes <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Got a bit too brown on top, might be better cooking at 160C instead of 170C <br>
                Pretty good. Probably should have a bit more salt(maybe 1.5x), and a bit more carrot too, maybe 150g<br>
                maybe a bit of alcohol - grand marnier could work <br>
                orange zest? <br>
                Was better next day, and from the fridge the icing tastes better too <br>
                Cream cheese should be the one in th brick form, which does seem to be significantly different to the one in the tub. Not sure if it can be found here...recipes are available on youtube <br>
                Some recipes used a bit of cornflour to thicken the icing <br>

                Bechamel should taste slightly too salty when preparing<br>

                Ingredients (for 18cm cake)<br>
                88g dried figs, finely chopped <br>
                48ml Armagnac or Cognac <br>
                88g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped. <br>
                115g hazelnuts, roasted and skins removed <br>
                48ml dried breadcrumbs <br>
                88g stick unsalted butter, softened <br>
                105g granulated sugar <br>
                Pinch of salt <br>
                2.5 large eggs, lightly beaten <br>
                <br>
                Glaze: <br>
                60g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped <br>
                50g lindor<br>
                144g full cream<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                cooked without fan for 20 minutes at 160C and 20 minutes at 190C. (recipe said 30 minutes at 190C, but i misread) <br>
                <br> <br>
                Result:<br>
                A bit overcooked, slightly burned around the sides. So 190C is probably too hot<br>
                Not sure about the chunks of dried figs - they have some quite hard pieces. Maybe they should be soaked in the alcohol much longer, or blended with it<br>
                Alcohol adds something really good <br>
                The ganache on the top is quite good too. I fucked it up a bit, by not adding the full amounts (should have used 88g 70% choc and 66g lindor) <br><br>
                Try again? <br>
                Defintely worth a second try due to overcooking, and potential inprovements above <br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                As recipe, but with using a bit of the instant coffee powder in crushed form, and vanilla extract & paste instead of beans<br>
                18cm cake. half recipe<br>
                Method:<br>
                As recipe <br>
                160C No fan. Baked on the shelf that's a bit below the middle of the oven <br>
                took out when digital thermometer showed 99C deep into the cake and about 94 near the surface <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Done Check: 40 minutes - Not even close. Done after 55<br>
                Tasted good, and better the next day<br>
                Should try again with all the coffee crushed, it's easier than dissolving and means less mess and liquid <br>
                Not super strong coffer flavor, but kept me awake :-D <br>
                Brown sugar would be good, maybe even some raw <br>
                Moist enough to eat alone, but maybe some icing to increase the coffee flavor would be good<br>
                Didn't get that much vanilla from it. Maybe could have some vanilla extract injected into it or sprayed on it before serving<br>

                Chicken was fine - would have been better presalted like zuni chicken. <br>
<br>
                Correctly salted and with pepper would have made it to a 7 or 8<br>

                70g butter<br>
                1/2 large onion<br>
                200g mix landrauchschinken & serrano<br>
                800ml milk<br>
                60g flour<br>
                pinch of freshly grated nutmeg <br>
                1 teaspoon salt <br>
                pinch of ground white pepper (ground black pepper will also do) <br>
                2 eggs  <br>
                100 g breadcrumbs <br>
                Light olive oil  or vegetable oil for deep-frying <br>

                Method:<br>
                As in recipe. fry onion in butter, fry ham in butter, add flour and give five minutes, add nutmeg. gradually add milk and simmer half an hour until thick<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too much ham<br>
                Consistency and breadcrumbs good<br>
                Careful with the salt,don't add it until the bechamel is fully cooked, as the ham adds saltiness<br>
                The landrauchschinken is too smoky<br>
                Next time 120g unsmoked ham, and 1/3 large onion<br>

                1 tbsp butter<br>
                200 gram ground beef<br>
                300g ground pork (original recipe was 200g beef, 100g pork, 100g veal, but this was what i could find)<br>
                3 tablespoons bread crumbs<br>
                200ml heavy cream<br>
                1 egg<br>
                1 tsp salt<br>
                Pinch of cinnamon<br>
                A pinch of grounded nutmeg<br>
                A pinch of grounded nutmeg<br>

                Result:<br>
                Pretty good. <br>
                The real recipe should be with lingonberries as the jam is too sweet<br>
                And the pickled cucumbers could be a bit less sweet than the standard recipe<br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                380 gm softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing<br>
                380 gm caster sugar<br>
                380 gm blanched whole almonds, finely ground<br>
                3 vanilla beans - substitute for 7 teaspoons vanilla paste & 3 teaspoons homemade vanilla extract<br>
                5 large eggs<br>
                200 gm walnuts, finely chopped<br>
                100 gm (2/3 cup) plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br>
                ½ tsp baking powder<br>
                125 ml amaretto<br>
<br>
                120g 70% chocolate<br>
                30g butter<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                As recipe, but reduced to 80% and used 8 inch tin instean of 10. realised later that the recipe should really be reduced to 64% for 8 inch rather than 10 inch tin<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Took cake out after 1 hour. Signs of readiness - 1) with probe showing 107C 2)skewer cleanish with few microcrumbs stuck. 3)shrinking very slightly away from the edge of the pan. <br>
                Probably cooked more or less the right amount - an extra few minutes wouldn't have done any harm either. Seemed maybe a bit too moist when still warm, 10 minutes from the oven. Cooling on cake rack might have been enough to reduce moisture a bit.<br>

                Method:<br>
                Made according to the recipe. <br>
                Notes from another recipe on Italia Squista: The meat mix here is 150g pancetta, 150g pork, 500g beef. They use a meat grinder to mince the vegetables finely along with some pancetta, and mince the beef and pork coarsely. They don't use dairy, but I like the dairy so fuck that. <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Pretty good - Should definitely try with the pork though. The vegetable size wasn't really an issue, so chopping them by hand rather than mincing is fine. <br>

                Made according to the recipe, frying off chicken in casserole while doing mushrooms in frying pan. Left chicken skin mostly on - not sure it thats a good idea or not<br>

                Trying my version of La Cucina Italia's tiramisu, with less egg yolk and sugar. Used 100ml coffee per 100g biscuits as it was hard to make them soak less.<br> <br>
                3 egg whites<br>
                2 egg yolks<br>
                55g Sugar<br>
                250g Mascarpone<br>
                1 tbsp Gran Marnier<br>
                100g Savoiardi Biscuits<br>
                100ml strong coffee<br>
                Unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too soggy. 100ml coffee to 100g biscuits was too much. Coffee probably not strong enough<br>
                Sugar was better. Could go up to 60g<br>
                Less egg yolk seemed good - maybe now there's less sugar it would be worth trying again with the extra yolk<br>
                Could have few more biscuits too. Probably 150g biscuits to 100ml coffee would be good<br>

                Made this, but with 2tbsp grand marnier instead of 4tbsp marsala<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Generally very good, but maybe a bit too sweet and slightly too many egg yolks making it richer than necesary<br>
                Created a recipe, and adjusted the amounts for next time <br>

                300g salmon <br>
                1/2 small beetroot<br>
                Zest of 1 orange<br>
                Zest of 1 lemon<br>
                Large bunch of dill<br>
                32g kosher salt<br>
                30g sugar<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Mix everything bar the dill and coat the salmon with the mixture. <br>
                Refrigerate for 24 hours, covered in plastic and weighted down with something.<br>
                Rinse the cure away, and let sit another half day in the fridge to allow salt to redistribute a bit.<br>
                Cover with finely chopped dill and serve.<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too salty, and not sure the beetroot brings much except color. <br>
                Should try again reducing either the salt or the cure time. (serious eats cure is 40g salt 25g sugar 900g salmon for 2 days)<br>
                White pepper is also a common addition. Coriander may also be good<br>

                Made this according to the recipe<br>
                Need to be careful with the batter as it wants to leak through even very small gaps in the pan. Had to use the cheaper pan as it sealed better<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Was a bit too oily - some suggested to use better quality oil, the other option would be to reduce the oil<br>
                Could also have done with a bit more orange flavor <br>
