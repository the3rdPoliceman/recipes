                <br>
                Method:<br>
                as recipe, but without pepper<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Flavor combination was generally good - worth trying in other recipes <br>
                Chicken was fine - would have been better presalted like zuni chicken. <br>
<br>
                Correctly salted and with pepper would have made it to a 7 or 8<br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                70g butter<br>
                1/2 large onion<br>
                200g mix landrauchschinken & serrano<br>
                800ml milk<br>
                60g flour<br>
                pinch of freshly grated nutmeg <br>
                1 teaspoon salt <br>
                pinch of ground white pepper (ground black pepper will also do) <br>
                2 eggs  <br>
                100 g breadcrumbs <br>
                Light olive oil  or vegetable oil for deep-frying <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                As in recipe. fry onion in butter, fry ham in butter, add flour and give five minutes, add nutmeg. gradually add milk and simmer half an hour until thick<br>

                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too much ham<br>
                Consistency and breadcrumbs good<br>
                Careful with the salt,don't add it until the bechamel is fully cooked, as the ham adds saltiness<br>
                The landrauchschinken is too smoky<br>
                Next time 120g unsmoked ham, and 1/3 large onion<br>

                200 gram ground beef<br>
                300g ground pork (original recipe was 200g beef, 100g pork, 100g veal, but this was what i could find)<br>
                3 tablespoons bread crumbs<br>
                200ml heavy cream<br>
                1 egg<br>
                1 tsp salt<br>
                Pinch of cinnamon<br>

                1 tbsp cooking oil + 1 tbsp butter for pan frying<br>
                cranberry jam and quick pickled cucumbers to serve<br>

                Result:<br>
                Pretty good. <br>
                The real recipe should be with lingonberries as the jam is too sweet<br>
                And the pickled cucumbers could be a bit less sweet than the standard recipe<br>

            <div class="log-detail">
                Ingredients:<br>
                380 gm softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing<br>
                380 gm caster sugar<br>
                380 gm blanched whole almonds, finely ground<br>
                3 vanilla beans - substitute for 7 teaspoons vanilla paste & 3 teaspoons homemade vanilla extract<br>
                5 large eggs<br>
                200 gm walnuts, finely chopped<br>
                100 gm (2/3 cup) plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br>
                Â½ tsp baking powder<br>
                125 ml amaretto<br>
<br>
                120g 70% chocolate<br>
                30g butter<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                As recipe, but reduced to 80% and used 8 inch tin instean of 10. realised later that the recipe should really be reduced to 64% for 8 inch rather than 10 inch tin<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Took cake out after 1 hour. Signs of readiness - 1) with probe showing 107C 2)skewer cleanish with few microcrumbs stuck. 3)shrinking very slightly away from the edge of the pan. <br>

                Probably cooked more or less the right amount - an extra few minutes wouldn't have done any harm either. Seemed maybe a bit too moist when still warm, 10 minutes from the oven. Cooling on cake rack might have been enough to reduce moisture a bit.<br>

                Good. Tried with thick chocolate spread - about 1 part cream, 2 parts chocolate melted and stirred together<br>

                80g butter<br>
                150g onions<br>

                40% of a nutmeg (was a guess)<br>
                450ml wine<br>

                Notes from another recipe on Italia Squista: The meat mix here is 150g pancetta, 150g pork, 500g beef. They use a meat grinder to mince the vegetables finely along with some pancetta, and mince the beef and pork coarsely. They don't use dairy, but I like the dairy so fuck that.
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Pretty good - Should definitely try with the pork though. The vegetable size wasn't really an issue, so chopping them by hand rather than mincing is fine.

                Trying my version of La Cucina Italia's tiramisu, with less egg yolk and sugar. Used 100ml coffee per 100g biscuits as it was hard to make them soak less.<br> <br>
                3 egg whites<br>
                2 egg yolks<br>
                55g Sugar<br>
                250g Mascarpone<br>
                1 tbsp Gran Marnier<br>
                100g Savoiardi Biscuits<br>
                100ml strong coffee<br>
                Unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                <br>    
                Result:<br>
                Too soggy. 100ml coffee to 100g biscuits was too much. Coffee probably not strong enough<br>
                Sugar was better. Could go up to 60g<br>
                Less egg yolk seemed good - maybe now there's less sugar it would be worth trying again with the extra yolk<br>
                Could have few more biscuits too. Probably 150g biscuits to 100ml coffee would be good<br>

                Made this, but with 2tbsp grand marnier instead of 4tbsp marsala<br> 
                <br>    
                Result:<br>
                Generally very good, but maybe a bit too sweet and slightly too many egg yolks making it richer than necesary<br>
                Created a recipe, and adjusted the amounts for next time

                300g salmon <br>
                1/2 small beetroot<br>
                Zest of 1 orange<br>
                Zest of 1 lemon<br>
                Large bunch of dill<br>
                32g kosher salt<br>
                30g sugar<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Mix everything bar the dill and coat the salmon with the mixture. <br>
                Refrigerate for 24 hours, covered in plastic and weighted down with something.<br>
                Rinse the cure away, and let sit another half day in the fridge to allow salt to redistribute a bit.<br>
                Cover with finely chopped dill and serve.<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too salty, and not sure the beetroot brings much except color. <br>
                Should try again reducing either the salt or the cure time. (serious eats cure is 40g salt 25g sugar 900g salmon for 2 days)<br>
                White pepper is also a common addition. Coriander may also be good<br>

                Sauce was great. Filling I used was a bit too smoked salmony, and i want to try with ricotto. Created a recipe for this<br>

                Made this according to the recipe<br> 
                Need to be careful with the batter as it wants to leak through even very small gaps in the pan. Had to use the cheaper pan as it sealed better<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Was a bit too oily - some suggested to use better quality oil, the other option would be to reduce the oil<br>
                Could also have done with a bit more orange flavor
