                What would happen if the peel was really increassed and the almond dropped? <br>
                could have something eytra orangy added when serving - seems too moist to take syrup (unless it was purposely cooked a bit longer than necessary?). Or maybe zest<br>

                Ingredients:<br>    
                CAKE <br>
                60g chopped walnuts <br>
                60g jacutinga sugar <br>
                60g light brown sugar <br>
                40g honey <br>
                40g granulated sugar <br>
                100ml peanut oil  <br>
                2 eggs <br>
                1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>
                140g all-purpose flour  <br>
                1 teaspoons baking powder <br>
                1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                2g teaspoon salt <br>
                1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon <br>
                1/4 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
                3/4 teaspoon cardamom <br>  
                1/4 tsp allspice <br>
                60g grated apple <br>
                150g grated carrots <br>
                30ml grand marnier <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Roasted nuts, mix wet ingredients, mix dry ingredients, combine, add rest, bake at 160C <br>
                Cooking time - 45 minutes @160C No fan, shelf just below middle. <br>
                Cake notes when taking out - 96C about 1cm from bottom, to 93C at top. Quiet Rice Krispie type sizzling. Firm to touch. Coming away from top. <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Bake color looks better - deep brown but no suggestion of burning <br>
                Can i notice the alcohol? Not really, could try going to 50ml<br>
                alcohol affect texture? Nope<br>
                More carrotty? Maybe a bit. Not really noticeable, but would keep it at 150<br>
                How is the spice? Cardamom good? Better, could have a bit more overall - Ginger is now more background, which is good<br>
                Any saltiness? Nope. 2g is no problem<br>
                Orange Zest on icing worth adding? Yep<br>

                ICING <br>
                75g full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature <br>
                20g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
                90g confectioners’ sugar <br>
                1/2 teaspoon heavy cream or milk <br>
                1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
                pinch of salt, to taste <br>

                Method:<br>
                As recipe, with substitutions for pecans (walnuts), dark brown sugar (jacutinga, LBS, honey) and applesauce (shredded apple). <br>
                Made one deep 18cm cake <br>
                Cooking time - 45 minutes <br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Got a bit too brown on top, might be better cooking at 160C instead of 170C <br>
                Pretty good. Probably should have a bit more salt(maybe 1.5x), and a bit more carrot too, maybe 150g<br>
                maybe a bit of alcohol - grand marnier could work <br>
                orange zest? <br>
                Was better next day, and from the fridge the icing tastes better too <br>
                Cream cheese should be the one in th brick form, which does seem to be significantly different to the one in the tub. Not sure if it can be found here...recipes are available on youtube <br>
                Some recipes used a bit of cornflour to thicken the icing <br>

                Bechamel should taste slightly too salty when preparing<br>

                Ingredients (for 18cm cake)<br>
                88g dried figs, finely chopped <br>
                48ml Armagnac or Cognac <br>
                88g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped. <br>
                115g hazelnuts, roasted and skins removed <br>
                48ml dried breadcrumbs <br>
                88g stick unsalted butter, softened <br>
                105g granulated sugar <br>
                Pinch of salt <br>
                2.5 large eggs, lightly beaten <br>
                <br>
                Glaze: <br>
                60g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped <br>
                50g lindor<br>
                144g full cream<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                cooked without fan for 20 minutes at 160C and 20 minutes at 190C. (recipe said 30 minutes at 190C, but i misread)
                <br> <br>
                Result:<br>
                A bit overcooked, slightly burned around the sides. So 190C is probably too hot<br>
                Not sure about the chunks of dried figs - they have some quite hard pieces. Maybe they should be soaked in the alcohol much longer, or blended with it<br>
                Alcohol adds something really good <br>
                The ganache on the top is quite good too. I fucked it up a bit, by not adding the full amounts (should have used 88g 70% choc and 66g lindor) <br><br>
                Try again? <br>
                Defintely worth a second try due to overcooking, and potential inprovements above <br>

                Ingredients:<br>
                As recipe, but with using a bit of the instant coffee powder in crushed form, and vanilla extract & paste instead of beans<br>
                18cm cake. half recipe<br>
                Method:<br>
                As recipe <br>
                160C No fan. Baked on the shelf that's a bit below the middle of the oven
                took out when digital thermometer showed 99C deep into the cake and about 94 near the surface
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Done Check: 40 minutes - Not even close. Done after 55<br>
                Tasted good, and better the next day<br>
                Should try again with all the coffee crushed, it's easier than dissolving and means less mess and liquid <br>
                Not super strong coffer flavor, but kept me awake :-D <br>
                Brown sugar would be good, maybe even some raw <br>
                Moist enough to eat alone, but maybe some icing to increase the coffee flavor would be good<br>
                Didn't get that much vanilla from it. Maybe could have some vanilla extract injected into it or sprayed on it before serving<br>

                Flavor combination was generally good - worth trying in other recipes <br>
                Chicken was fine - would have been better presalted like zuni chicken. <br>
<br>
                Correctly salted and with pepper would have made it to a 7 or 8<br>

                70g butter<br>
                1/2 large onion<br>
                200g mix landrauchschinken & serrano<br>
                800ml milk<br>
                60g flour<br>
                pinch of freshly grated nutmeg <br>
                1 teaspoon salt <br>
                pinch of ground white pepper (ground black pepper will also do) <br>
                2 eggs  <br>
                100 g breadcrumbs <br>
                Light olive oil  or vegetable oil for deep-frying <br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                As in recipe. fry onion in butter, fry ham in butter, add flour and give five minutes, add nutmeg. gradually add milk and simmer half an hour until thick<br>

                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too much ham<br>
                Consistency and breadcrumbs good<br>
                Careful with the salt,don't add it until the bechamel is fully cooked, as the ham adds saltiness<br>
                The landrauchschinken is too smoky<br>
                Next time 120g unsmoked ham, and 1/3 large onion<br>

                200 gram ground beef<br>
                300g ground pork (original recipe was 200g beef, 100g pork, 100g veal, but this was what i could find)<br>
                3 tablespoons bread crumbs<br>
                200ml heavy cream<br>
                1 egg<br>

                Pretty good. <br>
                The real recipe should be with lingonberries as the jam is too sweet<br>
                And the pickled cucumbers could be a bit less sweet than the standard recipe<br>

            <div class="log-detail">
                Ingredients:<br>
                380 gm softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing<br>
                380 gm caster sugar<br>
                380 gm blanched whole almonds, finely ground<br>
                3 vanilla beans - substitute for 7 teaspoons vanilla paste & 3 teaspoons homemade vanilla extract<br>
                5 large eggs<br>
                200 gm walnuts, finely chopped<br>
                100 gm (2/3 cup) plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br>
                ½ tsp baking powder<br>
                125 ml amaretto<br>
<br>
                120g 70% chocolate<br>
                30g butter<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                As recipe, but reduced to 80% and used 8 inch tin instean of 10. realised later that the recipe should really be reduced to 64% for 8 inch rather than 10 inch tin<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Took cake out after 1 hour. Signs of readiness - 1) with probe showing 107C 2)skewer cleanish with few microcrumbs stuck. 3)shrinking very slightly away from the edge of the pan. <br>

                Probably cooked more or less the right amount - an extra few minutes wouldn't have done any harm either. Seemed maybe a bit too moist when still warm, 10 minutes from the oven. Cooling on cake rack might have been enough to reduce moisture a bit.<br>

                150g celery<br>
                750g beef schulter braten hackfleish<br>
                450ml whole milk<br>
                40% of a nutmeg (was a guess)<br>
                450ml wine<br>
                2 cans tomatoes<br>
                Salt and pepper<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Made according to the recipe. <br>
                Notes from another recipe on Italia Squista: The meat mix here is 150g pancetta, 150g pork, 500g beef. They use a meat grinder to mince the vegetables finely along with some pancetta, and mince the beef and pork coarsely. They don't use dairy, but I like the dairy so fuck that.
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Pretty good - Should definitely try with the pork though. The vegetable size wasn't really an issue, so chopping them by hand rather than mincing is fine.

                Trying my version of La Cucina Italia's tiramisu, with less egg yolk and sugar. Used 100ml coffee per 100g biscuits as it was hard to make them soak less.<br> <br>
                3 egg whites<br>
                2 egg yolks<br>
                55g Sugar<br>
                250g Mascarpone<br>
                1 tbsp Gran Marnier<br>
                100g Savoiardi Biscuits<br>
                100ml strong coffee<br>
                Unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                <br>    
                Result:<br>
                Too soggy. 100ml coffee to 100g biscuits was too much. Coffee probably not strong enough<br>
                Sugar was better. Could go up to 60g<br>
                Less egg yolk seemed good - maybe now there's less sugar it would be worth trying again with the extra yolk<br>
                Could have few more biscuits too. Probably 150g biscuits to 100ml coffee would be good<br>

                Made this, but with 2tbsp grand marnier instead of 4tbsp marsala<br> 
                <br>    
                Result:<br>
                Generally very good, but maybe a bit too sweet and slightly too many egg yolks making it richer than necesary<br>
                Created a recipe, and adjusted the amounts for next time

                300g salmon <br>
                1/2 small beetroot<br>
                Zest of 1 orange<br>
                Zest of 1 lemon<br>
                Large bunch of dill<br>
                32g kosher salt<br>
                30g sugar<br>
                <br>
                Method:<br>
                Mix everything bar the dill and coat the salmon with the mixture. <br>
                Refrigerate for 24 hours, covered in plastic and weighted down with something.<br>
                Rinse the cure away, and let sit another half day in the fridge to allow salt to redistribute a bit.<br>
                Cover with finely chopped dill and serve.<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Too salty, and not sure the beetroot brings much except color. <br>
                Should try again reducing either the salt or the cure time. (serious eats cure is 40g salt 25g sugar 900g salmon for 2 days)<br>
                White pepper is also a common addition. Coriander may also be good<br>

                Made this according to the recipe<br> 
                Need to be careful with the batter as it wants to leak through even very small gaps in the pan. Had to use the cheaper pan as it sealed better<br>
                <br>
                Result:<br>
                Was a bit too oily - some suggested to use better quality oil, the other option would be to reduce the oil<br>
                Could also have done with a bit more orange flavor
