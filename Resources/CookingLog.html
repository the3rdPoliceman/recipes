                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Pretty good. Something was slightly bitter in the sauce - could have been the frozen mussels, or maybe the vegatables weren't cooked quite enough <br> <br>
                        Would try again, but with fresh instead of frozen mussels and a less cheap wine <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        CAKE <br>
                        125g walnuts <br>
                        125g hazelnuts <br>
                        150g butter <br>
                        200g brown sugar <br>
                        2 eggs <br>
                        1 egg yolk <br>
                        100g plain flour <br>
                        1 tsp baking powder <br>
                        3g salt <br>
                        1tbsp instant coffee, dissolved in as little hot water as possible <br>
                        30ml vanilla rum <br>
                        100ml oil <br>
                        ICING <br>
                        160g icing sugar <br>
                        80g butter <br>
                        1 teaspoon instant coffee <br>
                        1 tsp vanilla rum <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Roast the nuts, then chop the walnuts, and grind the hazelnuts into powder <br>
                        Cream the butter and sugar, stir in the nuts, and gradually beat in the eggs <br>
                        Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Combine the coffee vanilla and oil, and fold into the mix <br>
                        Bake at 160C until done (around 40 minutes) <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Really happy with this <br>
                        The oil is a good addition as the cake is very moist, although i think i overdid it a bit. I reduced the oil and butter in the recipe a bit. <br>
                        It uses less coffee in the cake than some of the other recipes I tried. This seems good - the other recipes used a huge amount of coffee, but even then the flavor was a bit lost. Relying on the coffee icing for coffee flavor seems to be better. <br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Good texture. <br>
                        Coffee flavor was good enough, although it felt a bit one dimensional. Maybe partly due to oil instead of butter<br>
                        Brown sugar would have been an improvement. <br>
                        As a non iced cake, it would need more sugar. With the sweet white chocolate icing, it should be fine<br>
                        Could use some vanilla in there too, and maybe some alcohol <br><br>
                        In general, the other coffee cake from river cafe was better. Neither had super strong coffee flavor, so maybe it's better to reduce the coffee in the cake and have most of the coffee flavor coming from the icing. For texture, trying 2/3 butter, 1/3 oil wold be interesting.

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        200 ml of water <br>
                        80 grams of butter <br>
                        10 grams of Sugar <br>
                        A pinch of Salt <br>
                        3 eggs (for the dough) <br>
                        1 egg (for the glazing) <br>
                        100 grams of plain flour <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Put the water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer for a couple of minutes <br>
                        Take off the heat, dump the flour in, and quickly whisk together until combined <br>
                        Place back on a moderate heat, and cook while stirring until a crust forms on the bottom of the saucepam <br>
                        Leave to cool a bit, the beat in the eggs one at a time (it will split and then come together as you add each egg). You should add the egg slowly toward the end until it reaches the correct consistency. The correct consistency occurs has been reached when you can hold a big spoonful sidewards, and it falls off slowly in a single large blob<br>
                        Pipe into the desired shape<br>
                        Knock off any tips by wetting your finger and poking them, before glazing with the final beaten egg <br>
                        Cook at 200C fan for about 30 minutes, until well browned <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Great. <br>
                        There are a lot of variations in this <br> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>butter can be between 50% and 100% of the flour weight. More butter gives more crispness and flavor, although maybe more softness too (just my theory)</li>
                            <li>some use half milk, half water. More milk is said to give flavour and color, while more water should give a crisper result</li>
                            <li>sugar is not standard, but i guess it works for sweet recipes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        3 lemons <br>
                        100g sugar <br>
                        350ml water <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Chop up half a lemon and pick out the seeds, put in a blender (so, the pith, zest and flesh)<br>
                        Zest the remaining lemons and put the zest in a saucepan with the sugar and 100ml of the water. Bring to the boil to make a syrup <br>
                        Juice the remaining lemons, and put the juice in the blender along with the remaining 250ml water <br>
                        Once you have your syrup, add that to the blender also, and blend thoroughly until very smooth <br>
                        Chill, and churn <br>

                        Not so smooth as it coud be. Probably better to do the blending with less liquid <br>

                        Chop up half of one of the lemons, with the skin but without seeds. Blend it along with the sugar <br>

                        Didn't do this: Whisk the egg yolks, and then mix a little of the bechamel into them before adding back into the rest of the bechamel<br>

                        They ended up too salty, but more or less everything else was good <br>
                        Try 3g salt next time (although it will always depends a bit on the ham) <br>
                        Info: Serrano ham is about 5% salt - so 110g = 5.5g salt <br> 
                        Info: Cooked ham is about 2.5% salt - so 110g = 5.5g salt <br>

                        80g brown sugar <br>
                        30g inverted sugar <br>
                        2g salt <br>
                        10g gin <br>
                        5g vanilla rum <br>
                        150ml full cream <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Blend everything except the cream, then carefully stir in the cream<br>
                        Chill and freeze <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Much better flavor. Could still use a tiny bit less sugar - maybe 70g sugar &amp; 30g inverted sugar <br>

                        Pretty sure it was blending the cream that caused the issue last time, by turning it into butter<br>
                        Next time, could reduce the cream to 150ml, and the sugar to 90g. Could also try adding the lemon juice again<br>

                        Not sure if it was split because of acid, or because i blended the cream. In any case, it had split before it started freezing<br>
                        Next time, would try stirring the cream rather than blending <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        400g raspberries <br>
                        50g sugar <br>
                        1 tbsp flour <br>
                        0.5 tbsp cornflour <br>
                        juice of 0.5 lemon <br>
                        200g oats <br>
                        190g flour <br>
                        200g brown sugar <br>
                        0.5 tsp baking powder <br>
                        100g butter, melted <br>
                        80g coconut fat, melted  <br>
                        0.25 tsp salt <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        More or less according to recipe. The only difference is using coconut fat and butter instead of only butter <br><br>
                        Defrost and strain raspberries, then mix with sugar, flour, cornflour, lemon <br>
                        Mix the rest into crumble <br>
                        Bake two thirds of the crumble mix in a lined pan (blue one) for 10 minutes at 160C fan <br>
                        Tip raspberry mix on top, followed by the rest of the crumble, and bake for 25 minutes more <br>
                        Let cool down and slice <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Not bad - raspberry flapjack basically <br>
                        Needs a less raspberry (probably half is enough), and the raspberry mix should be sweeter <br>

                        180g butter, diced <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Fry shallots and thyme with a knob of the butter until soft, then empty into blender <br>
                        Fry chicken livers quickly until browned, but very pink inside. Add to blender<br>
                        Add cognac to pan and reduce to syrup. Add to the blender<br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Much better. Consistency was much better because of the extra butter and less cream <br>
                        Cognac is much better than grand marnier <br>
                        Peppercorns are good, but maybe 2 teaspoons would be enough <br>

                        Too creamy - maybe cut that down to 30ml. Increase the butter to add fat, and solidify more <br>
                        Grand Marnier was a mistake - too sweet - cognac would be better <br>
                        Spices are ok - bit more salt would be good - try 4.5g <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Soften butter and rub over oranges <br>
                        Dip oranges in sugar <br>
                        Add 80g sugar to 25*20cm tray, and put oranges on top. Keep rest of sugar aside<br>
                        Bake at 210 until sugar browning <br>
                        Remove and reserve the sugar, then quarter the oranges and return them to oven until they get quite dark brown (chocolatey shade) <br>
                        Scoop out the flesh of one orange and discard <br>
                        Blend the sugar from the oven, the orange and orange peel, and the remaining sugar, then pass through a sieve <br>
                        Heat the puree in a saucepan until bubbling, beat remaining ingredients together in a bowl, and then add the pure and whisk together <br>
                        Chill and freeze <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Not amazing, but interesting and pretty good. Bitter, but not too bitter - might go well with something very sweet <br>

                        1L chicken stock <br>
                        16 sheets <br>
                        800g can peeled whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano <br>
                        150g finely minced chicken livers <br>
                        60ml extra-virgin olive oil <br>
                        700g ground beef siedfleisch (about 20% fat) <br>
                        750g ground pork shoulder (about 20% fat) <br>
                        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>
                        60g unsalted butter <br>
                        100g finely diced pancetta <br>
                        1 large onion, finely minced <br>
                        2 carrots, finely chopped  <br>
                        4 ribs celery, finely chopped  <br>
                        4 medium cloves garlic, minced <br>
                        20g fresh sage leaves, shredded <br>
                        50g fresh parsley leaves, chopped <br>
                        500ml dry white or red wine <br>
                        250ml whole milk <br>
                        2 bay leaves <br>
                        250ml heavy cream <br>
                        85g finely grated Parmesan cheese <br>
                        30ml fish sauce <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Made according to the recipe. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Pretty good overall - I think I slightly preferred this over marcella hazans<br>
                        It tasted really good before adding the fish sauce and parmesan at the end, and worse after. So, I would skip the fish sauce, and carefully taste while adding the parmesan <br>
                        I oversalted a bit early on, so be careful of this<br>
                        The pork/beef/pancetta mix was definitely better than just beef. The coarse grind from the person at the meat counter was definitely good too <br>
                        Gelatine was great, the sauce had a nice consistency <br>
                        The method was easy, but I would need a bigger oven dish to cook it all <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        2 liters water <br>
                        10 * 12cm kombu <br>
                        40g bonito flakes <br>
                        100g miso paste (caramel color) (optional)<br>
                        20ml mirin  <br>
                        tofu <br>
                        dried wakame <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Heat cold water with kombu until boiling <br>
                        Turn off heat, remove kombu, add bonito, let steep for 2 minutes then strain. Now you have dashi<br>
                        Whisk the miso paste into the dashi and add the mirin <br>
                        Serve with some tofu cubes and about half a teaspoon dried wakame per cup <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>   
                        Not bad, but could have been a bit stronger flavor. Maybe needed some extra kombu in the dashi, and letting the bonito flakes simmer in it for a while (not much though, as most recipes don't, or just very briefly)<br>
                        Some suggest soaking the kombu in the water overnight before making the dashi <br>
                        note: shouldn't let the water boil when the kombu is in the water. Take it out just before boiling (this is in all the recipes, and seems important) <br>

                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Flatten chicken - wing tips off, wishbone out, remove breast bone, cut around remaining bones. Basically get as flat as possible and o that all skin is on one side so it can be fried on that <br>
                        Salt with 1% salt by weight, and leave in fridge <br>
                        Put skin side down in a cold pan, and slowly fry over medium-low heat until skin is super golden crispy and chicken is nearly cooked through <br>
                        Flip it, and add butter, garlic and thyme, and continue frying until cooked through <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Very crispy skin, good flavor and moist <br>

                        45g tablespoons bread crumbs <br>
                        150ml heavy cream <br>
                        1 tsp salt <br>

                        3 tablespoons grated parmesan <br>
                        large pinch of nutmeg <br>
                        1 egg <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Mix all to nutmeg, and leave to stand for 10 minutes <br>
                        Beat egg into cream, followed by onion, then mix into the meat <br>
                        Ballify, and coat some in breadcrumbs <br>
                        Fry in olive oil until brown  <br>
                        Remove all the fat from the pan, add tomatoes, cover and simmer 20 minutes <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        bit too bready - 25g inside would be enough, then reduce the cream to 100g <br>
                        should add some more herbs - oregano or rosemary <br>
                        can skip the breadcrumb coating <br>

                        20g brown sugar <br>
                        10ml light soy sauce (should be white, a.k.a. shiro) <br>
                        2 tablespoons mirin <br>
                        <br>

                        Technically, was good <br>
                        In the recipe it should brown on top, which mine didn't really, but I don't think that's a big issue <br>
                        Flavorwise, it might be a bit strong on soy and sugar. Not sure it's better than rolled omelette and might be more delicate<br>

                        Add the spinach, fry a few minutes, check for salt and add the coriander <br>
                        Make 4 indentations and crack an egg into each <br>
                        Add a couple of spoons of water to the pan, sprinkle with feta, and cover with a lid until the eggs are cooked <br>

                        5 Potatoes, Peeled & Sliced 6mm thick <br>
                        Sprig of Thyme <br>
                        40g Butter <br>
                        1/4 Onion, finely sliced <br>
                        1/2 Leek, sliced <br>

                    <div class="log-detail">
                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        4 eggs, separated <br>
                        160g caster sugar <br>
                        150g ground almonds <br>
                        finely grated zest of 2 oranges <br>
                        juice of 5 oranges, preferably Seville <br>
                        juice of 1 lemon (if not using Seville oranges) <br>
                        1 stick cinnamon <br>
                        caster sugar to taste <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Heat oven to 180C and Line Pan. <br>
                        Put a tablespoon of the caster sugar in with the egg whites <br>
                        Beat the rest of the caster sugar with the egg yolks until pale <br>
                        Mix in the almonds and zest <br>
                        Beat the egg whites and sugar until stiff and then fold into the egg mixture <br>
                        Bake for about 60-70 minutes until golden on top and firm to the touch <br>
                        <br>
                        To make some orange syrup, gently simmer the orange juice, lemon juice, cinnamon and a handful of sugar for about five minutes. Taste for sugar – the syrup should be quite tart. Allow to cool <br>
                        <br>
                        When the cake is ready, remove it from the oven and allow to cool before opening the spring-form tin <br>
                        Transfer it to a plate and pierce holes in the top <br>
                        Soak about up to about half of the syrup into the torta <br>
                        <br>
                        Serve the remaining syrup on the side <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Technical problems, but taste was good. <br>
                        Looks nothing like the one on the guardian page <br>
                        Rose and sank pretty severely, leaving it looking like a skateboarding bowl. Maybe less egg white....or more?...internet suggests both. Seemed overly full in the first place. <br>
                        Overcooked on top and bottom. Probably should reduce cooking temp a bit <br>
                        <br><br>
                        Did various syrups with 50g sugar, 500ml orange juice, 40ml lemon juice (reduced by, 35%, 50%, 60%, 70%). 50% reduced might be good for penetrating the cake, and 60% reduced would be good for serving with the cake. <br>
                        Few flaked almonds or pistachios on top would help appearance <br>
                        If I can't stop this collapsing, one option would be to cut the top off and flip it. Possibly also candied orange slices in the bottom which would then be the top. <br>

                        1⁄2 small onion, finely chopped <br>
                        3 slices prosciutto, finely chopped <br>

                        150g ricotta <br>
                        1 egg yolk <br>
                        30g grated parmesan <br>
                        2 pinches grated nutmeg <br>
                        <br>

                        Add the spinach, fry and taste for salt <br>
                        In a bowl, mix the ricotta, egg yolk, parmesan and nutmeg <br>
                        Let the spinach cool a bit, mix everything together, and taste for salt &amp; nutmeg <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Suggestion is to serve this with tomato sauce, but it masked the flavour a bit. I would go for cream next time<br>

                        This was better than the previous attempt without the ricotta. Might have had too much ricotta though, or maybe could have used an egg yolk to stabilize the filling <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        170g Chocolate 70%  <br>
                        2.5 eggs <br>
                        112g butter <br>
                        105g caster sugar <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Eggs + 35g sugar beaten until volume quadruples <br>
                        Melt chocolate and butter <br>
                        Make syrup from remaining sugar + 50ml water  <br>
                        Add syrup to choc and let cool a bit <br>
                        Add the chocolate to the eggs, and beat slowly until the mixture is combined <br>
                        Pour into the tin <br>
                        Bain marie at 120C until top is set and you can bring it a bit away from the sides (maybe 50 minutes for 25cm tin) <br>
                        Took out of the oven after 45 minutes. Top was set, inner temp was 80C, could just about persuade it away from the sides of the tin  <br>
                        Chill completely in fridge <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        maybe could cook it slightly more - try until 85C <br>
                        initially thought it wasn't cooked enough, as it was more like mousse when still warm. But after chilling in the fridge, it was good <br>
                        should try with some really good chocolate <br>

                        100g bitter chocolate, 90% cocoa solids  <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Butter infused with tea if using <br>
                        Almonds blitzed to coarse sand, likewise mandarin peel, and chocolate if using <br>
                        Butter and sugars beaten, vanilla and egg yolk added gradually <br>
                        Dry ingredients combined, then folded in <br>
                        Egg whites whisked, then folded in <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Not bad tastewise <br>
                        Could have had a little more sugar. maybe 25g <br>
                        Mandarin peel affected the texture quite a lot - tasted like it had oatmeal in it <br>

                        What would happen if the peel was really increassed and the almond dropped? <br>
                        could have something eytra orangy added when serving - seems too moist to take syrup (unless it was purposely cooked a bit longer than necessary?). Or maybe zest<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        CAKE <br>
                        60g chopped walnuts <br>
                        60g jacutinga sugar <br>
                        60g light brown sugar <br>
                        40g honey <br>
                        40g granulated sugar <br>
                        100ml peanut oil  <br>
                        2 eggs <br>
                        1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>
                        140g all-purpose flour  <br>
                        1 teaspoons baking powder <br>
                        1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                        2g teaspoon salt <br>
                        1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon <br>
                        1/4 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
                        3/4 teaspoon cardamom <br>
                        1/4 tsp allspice <br>
                        60g grated apple <br>
                        150g grated carrots <br>
                        30ml grand marnier <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Roasted nuts, mix wet ingredients, mix dry ingredients, combine, add rest, bake at 160C <br>
                        Cooking time - 45 minutes @160C No fan, shelf just below middle. <br>
                        Cake notes when taking out - 96C about 1cm from bottom, to 93C at top. Quiet Rice Krispie type sizzling. Firm to touch. Coming away from top. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Bake color looks better - deep brown but no suggestion of burning <br>
                        Can i notice the alcohol? Not really, could try going to  or just forget it<br>
                        alcohol affect texture? Nope<br>
                        More carrotty? Maybe a bit. Not really noticeable, but would keep it at 150<br>
                        How is the spice? Cardamom good? Better, could have a bit more overall - Ginger is now more background, which is good<br>
                        Any saltiness? Nope. 2g is no problem<br>
                        Orange Zest on icing worth adding? Yep<br>

                        ICING <br>
                        75g full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature <br>
                        20g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
                        90g confectioners’ sugar <br>
                        1/2 teaspoon heavy cream or milk <br>
                        1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
                        pinch of salt, to taste <br>

                        As recipe, with substitutions for pecans (walnuts), dark brown sugar (jacutinga, LBS, honey) and applesauce (shredded apple). <br>
                        Made one deep 18cm cake <br>
                        Cooking time - 45 minutes <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Got a bit too brown on top, might be better cooking at 160C instead of 170C <br>
                        Pretty good. Probably should have a bit more salt(maybe 1.5x), and a bit more carrot too, maybe 150g<br>
                        maybe a bit of alcohol - grand marnier could work <br>
                        orange zest? <br>
                        Was better next day, and from the fridge the icing tastes better too <br>
                        Cream cheese should be the one in th brick form, which does seem to be significantly different to the one in the tub. Not sure if it can be found here...recipes are available on youtube <br>
                        Some recipes used a bit of cornflour to thicken the icing <br>

                        Maybe a bit bland. Some pepper would be good. <br>
                        Bechamel should taste slightly too salty when preparing<br>
                        Some people are adding an egg yolk to the bechamel for richness<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients</strong> (for 18cm cake)<br>
                        88g dried figs, finely chopped <br>
                        48ml Armagnac or Cognac <br>
                        88g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped. <br>
                        115g hazelnuts, roasted and skins removed <br>
                        48ml dried breadcrumbs <br>
                        88g stick unsalted butter, softened <br>
                        105g granulated sugar <br>
                        Pinch of salt <br>
                        2.5 large eggs, lightly beaten <br>
                        <br>
                        Glaze: <br>
                        60g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped <br>
                        50g lindor<br>
                        144g full cream<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        cooked without fan for 20 minutes at 160C and 20 minutes at 190C. (recipe said 30 minutes at 190C, but i misread) <br>
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        A bit overcooked, slightly burned around the sides. So 190C is probably too hot<br>
                        Not sure about the chunks of dried figs - they have some quite hard pieces. Maybe they should be soaked in the alcohol much longer, or blended with it<br>
                        Alcohol adds something really good <br>
                        The ganache on the top is quite good too. I fucked it up a bit, by not adding the full amounts (should have used 88g 70% choc and 66g lindor) <br><br>
                        Try again? <br>
                        Defintely worth a second try due to overcooking, and potential inprovements above <br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        As recipe, but with using a bit of the instant coffee powder in crushed form, and vanilla extract & paste instead of beans<br>
                        18cm cake. half recipe<br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        As recipe <br>
                        160C No fan. Baked on the shelf that's a bit below the middle of the oven <br>
                        took out when digital thermometer showed 99C deep into the cake and about 94 near the surface <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Done Check: 40 minutes - Not even close. Done after 55<br>
                        Tasted good, and better the next day<br>
                        Should try again with all the coffee crushed, it's easier than dissolving and means less mess and liquid <br>
                        Not super strong coffer flavor, but kept me awake :-D <br>
                        Brown sugar would be good, maybe even some raw <br>
                        Moist enough to eat alone, but maybe some icing to increase the coffee flavor would be good<br>
                        Didn't get that much vanilla from it. Maybe could have some vanilla extract injected into it or sprayed on it before serving<br>

                        Flavor combination was generally good - worth trying in other recipes <br>
                        Chicken was fine - would have been better presalted like zuni chicken. <br>

                        Correctly salted and with pepper would have made it to a 7 or 8<br>

                        70g butter<br>
                        1/2 large onion<br>

                        60g flour<br>
                        pinch of freshly grated nutmeg <br>
                        1 teaspoon salt <br>
                        pinch of ground white pepper (ground black pepper will also do) <br>

                        Consistency and breadcrumbs good<br>
                        Careful with the salt,don't add it until the bechamel is fully cooked, as the ham adds saltiness<br>
                        The landrauchschinken is too smoky<br>

                        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                        380 gm softened unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing<br>
                        380 gm caster sugar<br>

                        3 vanilla beans - substitute for 7 teaspoons vanilla paste & 3 teaspoons homemade vanilla extract<br>
                        5 large eggs<br>

                        As recipe, but reduced to 80% and used 8 inch tin instean of 10. realised later that the recipe should really be reduced to 64% for 8 inch rather than 10 inch tin<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Took cake out after 1 hour. Signs of readiness - 1) with probe showing 107C 2)skewer cleanish with few microcrumbs stuck. 3)shrinking very slightly away from the edge of the pan. <br>
                        Probably cooked more or less the right amount - an extra few minutes wouldn't have done any harm either. Seemed maybe a bit too moist when still warm, 10 minutes from the oven. Cooling on cake rack might have been enough to reduce moisture a bit.<br>

                        1 egg<br>
                        0.5g salt<br>
                        5g sugar<br>
                        120ml milk<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Method:</strong><br>
                        Melt butter in the pan<br>
                        Put everything else, but only a bit of the milk in a bowl and mix until smooth<br>
                        Add the rest of the milk, enough to make it thin<br>
                        Dump the melted butter in to the batter<br>
                        Mix again, then cook your crepes<br>
                        When cooking a crepe, dump the batter in one side of the pan and let it flow to the other, rather than dumping in the middle<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Good. Tried with thick chocolate spread - about 1 part cream, 2 parts chocolate melted and stirred together<br>

                        450ml wine<br>

                        Notes from another recipe on Italia Squista: The meat mix here is 150g pancetta, 150g pork, 500g beef. They use a meat grinder to mince the vegetables finely along with some pancetta, and mince the beef and pork coarsely. They don't use dairy, but I like the dairy so fuck that. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Pretty good - Should definitely try with the pork though. The vegetable size wasn't really an issue, so chopping them by hand rather than mincing is fine. <br>

                        Trying my version of La Cucina Italia's tiramisu, with less egg yolk and sugar. Used 100ml coffee per 100g biscuits as it was hard to make them soak less.<br> <br>
                        3 egg whites<br>
                        2 egg yolks<br>
                        55g Sugar<br>
                        250g Mascarpone<br>
                        1 tbsp Gran Marnier<br>
                        100g Savoiardi Biscuits<br>
                        100ml strong coffee<br>
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Too soggy. 100ml coffee to 100g biscuits was too much. Coffee probably not strong enough<br>
                        Sugar was better. Could go up to 60g<br>
                        Less egg yolk seemed good - maybe now there's less sugar it would be worth trying again with the extra yolk<br>
                        Could have few more biscuits too. Probably 150g biscuits to 100ml coffee would be good<br>

                        Refrigerate for 24 hours, covered in plastic and weighted down with something.<br>
                        Rinse the cure away, and let sit another half day in the fridge to allow salt to redistribute a bit.<br>

                        Should try again reducing either the salt or the cure time. (serious eats cure is 40g salt 25g sugar 900g salmon for 2 days)<br>
                        White pepper is also a common addition. Coriander may also be good<br>

                        Made this according to the recipe<br>
                        Need to be careful with the batter as it wants to leak through even very small gaps in the pan. Had to use the cheaper pan as it sealed better<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        Was a bit too oily - some suggested to use better quality oil, the other option would be to reduce the oil<br>
                        Could also have done with a bit more orange flavor <br>
