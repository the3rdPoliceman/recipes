tempura


egg, water, flour

equal volume water and flour
one egg per 200-500ml water
bit of potato or maybe corn starch to increase crispiness
low gluten flour is better as more gluten increases sogginess (cake, for example)
water should be cold
don't mix much (should be lumpy)
to get a batter with a longer lasting crispiness (but a bit less light texture), a little oil can be added to the batter (maybe 10 ml to 200ml water). this stops gluten forming 


dip the ingredient in cake flour, then in the batter, then put in the oil

as it cooks, it'll rise to the surface, and the bubbles will gradually get smaller	(this is because the batter is drying out and less water is coming off)

some people like to increase the temperature of the oil at the end of cooking an item, to the les viscous oil drains off better

tempura chefs check the oil temp by dripping the batter in and seeing how quickly and vigorously it rises to the top

add extra batter to the items while cooking if you wish
