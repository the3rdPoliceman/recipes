WHY DOES MY CARAMEL CRYSTALLISE?
The usual causes of crystallisation in caramel are
1 	less-than-clean pans
2 	impurities in the sugar 
3 	Heating too aggressively. The water should not simmer until all the sugar is dissolved
4 	Spoons, spatulas etc. Don't use any utensil to stir

HOW CAN I STOP IT CRYSTALLISING?
2 methods
1 	When you see the beginnings of crystallisation around the edge of the pan, brush a little water to dissolve the crystals.
2 	Put a lid on the pan, some of the water will condense and run down the edge of the pan dissolving crystals

More tips
Swirl rather than stir
Add a little acid (e.g. lemon juice) will discourage crystals from forming


WHAT DO I DO IF IT DOES CRYSTALLISE?
Add some lemon juice, or some more water and fully dissolve the caramel. Then continue
