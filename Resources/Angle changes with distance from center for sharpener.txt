Angle changes with distance from center


D1  distance of sharpening plate from center of rod
L  	length from rod pivot to contact point with knife blade
A 	angle created when rod vertical


1MM DIFFERENCE PER STONE

D1 		L 	 	A
12 		150 	4.57
15 		150 	5.71
19		150		7.22
23		150		8.72

Difference 1..12 = 4.15 degrees.  A progression through 12 sharpening stones, each 1mm further away from the rod center than the previous would gradually increase the angle, with a final angle 4.15 degrees greater than the original



0.5MM DIFFERENCE PER STONE

D1 		L 	 	A
12 		150 	4.57
13.5 	150 	5.14
15.5	150		5.9
17.5	150		6.65

Difference 1..12 = 2.08 degrees.  A progression through 12 sharpening stones, each 0.5mm further away from the rod center than the previous would gradually increase the angle, with a final angle 2.08 degrees greater than the original
