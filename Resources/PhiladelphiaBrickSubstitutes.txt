Experiments
1	75g Philadelphia tub, 20g butter, 90g icing sugar. Too runny
2	75g Migros, 20g butter, 90g icing sugar. Quite a bit better, still not totally stiff - ********** CURRENT BENCHMARK *********
3	75g Migros, 20g butter, 90g icing sugar, 7g milk powder. Not significantly better or worse than 2 - maybe a bit better taste, but maybe a bit granier too
4	75g Migros, 20g butter, 90g icing sugar, 15g milk powder. Way too grainy


Ideas
1	The philadelphia brick seems to have around 10g per 100g less water. Maybe put the more watery cheese in cheesecloth to squeeze out some water?
2	Adjust or remove water
3	Adjust Icing Sugar
3	Cornflour to thicken
