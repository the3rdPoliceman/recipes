ROAST POTATOES
Attempting to follow Heston's recipe. 


POSSIBLE IDEAS FROM SORTED
- Herbs, chicken stock and garlic in the water when boiling the potatoes - got a big thumbs up
- Fry in beef dripping
- Bicarb in the water (half teaspoon) when boiling to break the potato surfaces up and help browning (the breaking down element of this might be countered by hestons method of super boiling. Or it moght help break down some swiss potato varieties)
- If using herbs/garlic in the oven, add herbs late so they don't burn. Garlic can probably be added pretty early
- Potatoes can be tossed in a spoonful or two of cornflour after draining and roughing up. To increase crunch
- If not doing hestons method of total structural breakdown during boiling, it might be better slightly underboiling them, so they can be roughed up without falling apart


Varieties
AGRIA  
Never break down, even with extreme boiling


VICTORIA
Broke down a bit more, and could be scuffed up with rough colander shake. 
Final surface was tough rather than crunchy
Forgot to do initial rinse to remove starch
Tough rather than crunchy in the end


JELLY
Surface didn't break down much, with or without baking soda
They were rough upable though
Nice crunchy surface, with or without baking soda. Browning was improved a bit with soda, but not sure it made a difference to the crunch.
