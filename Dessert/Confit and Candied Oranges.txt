Confit Oranges
Ingredients
2 very fresh oranges
300 g white sugar
150 ml Water
1 tbsp baking soda
Method
Wash oranges well.
Dry and cut into thin slices.
Put in a saucepan and cover with water. Add the baking soda and bring to a boil. 
AS SOON as they start to boil, drain and put back in a clean saucepan. (If they boil too much the fruit disintegrates)

Cook over low heat for forty minutes, more or less, with the pan covered.
Remove and let cool in the pan.
Put the slices on a rack to dry.
