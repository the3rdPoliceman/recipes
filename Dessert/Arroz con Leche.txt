Arroz con leche
From Casa Gerardo
Ingredients
200 grams of rice
400 grams of water
2.6 liters full milk
2 cinnamon sticks 
A vanilla pod
Zest of 1 lemon, and 1/2 orange (big pieces)
100 grams of butter
350 grams of sugar
2 grams of salt
(Optional) Some alcohol - maybe anis, vodka, white rum
Method
Start boiling the milk, cinnamon, vanilla, zest in one pan.
Add the rice and water to another pan and cook until no liquid is left
Add the boiled milk and stuff to the rice and place on a medium heat.
Stir with a wooden spoon regularly until it boils. From here on it must be stirred continuously.
When the mixture becomes thick (leaves a trail on the spoon), gradually add the butter. 
Once the butter is well incorporated, remove the rice from the heat and let the temperature drop slightly. 
Sprinkle in the salt and 300g of sugar while stirring(whisking is probably too rough). 
Taste and see if it needs more sugar. While hot, it should taste a little too sweet.
Add the alcohol if using 
(Optional)Sprinkle sugar on top and grill
(Optional)Sprinkle powdered cinnamon on top
