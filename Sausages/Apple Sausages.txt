500ml Apple juice boiled down to 350 ml
200g Dried Apple, minced and soaked in the reduced apple juice
50 Salt
150ml White Wine

Standard sausage method
Minced everything through large die, might be better to use medium die for at least some of the mix.
Maybe apples should be chopped rather than minced to leave bigger pieces
