Fish Brining
Salmon Fillet
The thin bottom part of the fillet is removed as it always overcooks anyway.  
Brine is prepared by boiling half of the water with the salt to dissolve the salt, then adding the rest of the water in the form of ice.
Fish is submerged in the brine for the specified time, then rinsed, dried on kitchen paper and refrigerated for the resting time.
Fish is expected to firm up while resting, and the surface will be dry and slightly tacky.
Before cooking, fish will be tempered by leaving at room temperature for 1 hour.
